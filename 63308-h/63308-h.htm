<p>Several of the following sketches have appeared already in the
<i>Cambridge Review</i> and the <i>Cantab</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps the
friends who welcomed them then may welcome them now, on their
reappearance in another and more permanent form.</p>
<p>The story of &ldquo;Our Rector&rdquo; has been received in
episcopal quarters with polite incredulity.&nbsp; It may be that
episcopal supervision was less far-reaching in those days than
now.&nbsp; At any rate, the things I have narrated, and things
stranger still, <i>did</i> occur in our village, and in all
essential details, including the postprandial cigar, the story of
&ldquo;Our Rector&rdquo; is a literal &ldquo;study from
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would forget, if I could, that the &ldquo;Cruel, Crawling
Foam&rdquo; is also a record of fact.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">A SHADOW FROM THE PAST</span></h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Turn</span> your steps westward, and about
four miles beyond Bayview you will come to a rising ground where
three ways meet.</p>
<p>One&mdash;the road to the right&mdash;trends northward,
following with occasional deviations the coast line of Dead
Man&rsquo;s Bay, a replica in miniature of the Bay of Biscay, and
one which claims, almost as regularly, its tithe of life and
wreckage.</p>
<p>The path on the left hand enters a lodge gate, and begins to
fall gently but without intermission towards the sea.&nbsp; A
curious impression that you are reaching the end of all things is
followed by the feeling that your next step will be planted in
the sea&mdash;and then you come to Broadwater.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The huge
square-set building stands on a level plateau, guarded by a
semicircle of hills from every wind that blows, excepting the
south-west.&nbsp; The architecture is neither impressive in
itself nor characteristic of any particular period.&nbsp; Yet,
looking down upon it from the hills above, the eye will find
ample satisfaction in the colouring of the roof, for lichens have
painted the crumbling tiles with every conceivable hue of
vermilion and gold.</p>
<p>A stranger, journeying for the first time along the road,
would complain of the lack of trees.&nbsp; And trees in the open
there are none.&nbsp; Nothing less cringing than gorse and
heather can show front against the brine-laden winds of the
Atlantic.&nbsp; The south-west wind is jealous of its
prerogatives, and denudes a neighbourhood of isolated growth
almost as surely as does the poison-steeped atmosphere of the
midlands.</p>
<p>Yet, if you trouble to make nearer acquaintance with
Broadwater, you will find that every ravine and gully is crowded
with trees&mdash;&ldquo;groves&rdquo; the villagers call
them&mdash;whose tops lie level with the ground on either side,
so that a slight divergence from <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the recognised track might land the
unwary traveller among their foliage, almost without a change in
his plane of elevation.</p>
<p>The grand old house stands, as I have said, on a plateau,
protected from the north and east by the hills, down which the
road winds in and out like a white ribbon.&nbsp; On the west it
faces the Atlantic, and the lawn, merging in the park, falls
rapidly seawards till it meets the natural barrier of the
beach.&nbsp; As a rule the barrier stands well; yet times there
are when the sea will no longer &ldquo;harrow the valleys, or be
bound with a band in the furrow,&rdquo; but, laughing at the puny
obstruction, lays its tribute of drift and wreckage and human
life almost on the very door-step of the house.</p>
<p>Whether you love the scene or not, will depend on your age and
temperament, and something, too, on the circumstances under which
you view it.&nbsp; Steeped in the quiet twilight of an autumn
evening, its perfect stillness and repose appeal irresistibly to
a heart that yearns for rest, and many such have coveted
it.&nbsp; But let a Londoner come upon it when a furious
south-wester is raging, and the double windows are veiled with an
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>impermeable
film of brine, and you can feel the chimneys rocking
overhead&mdash;and the chances are he will hurry from it as from
the abomination of desolation.</p>
<p>After our uncle&rsquo;s death, Ronald, it was well known, was
to reign in his stead&mdash;supplanting myself, albeit the son of
an elder brother and the natural heir.&nbsp; But my father had
been unlucky enough to marry the woman of old Heyward&rsquo;s
choice, and the sin of the father was to be visited upon the
son.&nbsp; Our uncle (to do him justice) never made a pretence of
equity in the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should turn in my
grave,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I thought that son of his was to
follow in my room.&rdquo;&nbsp; And there the matter ended.&nbsp;
Short of this, he was fond of me in his own undemonstrative
way.&nbsp; Only lately he had settled me at Bayview with a
handsome allowance, where I was to make acquaintance with the
rudiments of the law till it was time for me to enter at
Cambridge.</p>
<p>Honestly I can say that I never grudged Ronald his
inheritance.&nbsp; He and I were brothers rather than cousins,
and I cannot remember the time when the sturdy little Viking was
not dear to my heart.&nbsp; Perhaps <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>it was I who gave the most, and he who
took it.&nbsp; But that is only as it should be, provided he who
gives and he who takes are equally nothing loth.</p>
<p>The house was an ideal home for us, so long as we shared it in
common.&nbsp; When we were separated, it became unutterably dull
for the one who was left companionless.&nbsp; Ghosts it must have
had in plenty.&nbsp; There certainly was an
&ldquo;impluvium,&rdquo; which in these days is rarer than a
ghost.&nbsp; I mean that the whole centre of the house was open
to the winds of heaven, for the purpose of collecting the rain
water which fell into a huge reservoir at the basement.</p>
<p>The ghosts, if any, never showed themselves&mdash;frightened
in all probability by the antagonism of Ronald&rsquo;s
temperament.&nbsp; But we discovered what was next best to the
real article&mdash;the equipments and paraphernalia of one.&nbsp;
In a disused coach-house we came one day on an old travelling
carriage of the fashion in use sixty years ago, when
paterfamilias took himself and his family for a progress round
the country.&nbsp; Rumble it had, and imperial, and a chest of
most unearthly pattern, accommodated to the space under the back
seat.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But the
glass was broken in the frames, and the hangings were
mouldy.&nbsp; The very woodwork was so worm-eaten that at a touch
you would expect it to crumble into dust, like one of the
Pharaohs when he is disencumbered of his trappings.&nbsp; It was
painted&mdash;or rather had been painted&mdash;a sable black, but
the colour had deteriorated with time to the hue of rusty
cr&ecirc;pe.</p>
<p>Our first impression suggested that it was some time-honoured
memorial of the past&mdash;the carriage, it might be, in which a
bride and bridegroom had made their home-coming under auspices of
exceptional promise.&nbsp; But a second glance through the broken
semicircular skylight told rather of intentional neglect or
indifference.&nbsp; The plaster of the coach-house, where it
still clung to the lath, had broken out into patches of
mouldiness, defiant of the first principles of cleanliness, while
an army of spiders, who must have worked unmolested for years,
had tied the carriage to the walls and floor with a net-work of
dirt-begrimed strands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is it? and why is it kept here?&rdquo;
asked Ronald of the groom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall get the uncle to
have it broken up and burned: <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>it&rsquo;s only filling the place with
moths and insects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do nought of the kind, Master
Ronald,&rdquo; said the coachman, lowering his voice to a
whisper.&nbsp; &ldquo;That carriage has been driven up to these
very doors by old Nick himself, or one or other of his
coachmen.&nbsp; Aye, you may laugh.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s true
enough, and not so long ago neither.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d
forgotten&mdash;had your aunt and uncle&mdash;that it was here in
the stable at all: it must have been here years before they
bought the place&mdash;till <i>he</i> came and drove it round to
the front door one night, all mouldy and ramshackled just as you
see it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell us, Frampton, about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
promise not to laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;twas the night before we were starting for
the South of France, and I was going with them to look after the
horses they were to hire in Paris.&nbsp; The house had been full
of visitors for Christmas, but most of them had gone the day
before, and the rest of them were to leave along with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the middle of the night, though they never
noticed the true time, when they <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>heard, both of them, a carriage drive
up to the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were fairly puzzled what it could mean, as they
expected no visitors, least of all at that time of night.&nbsp;
Your aunt got up first and then called your uncle.&nbsp; And
there, full in the moonlight, stood that identical carriage, and
the coachman was a skellington&mdash;dressed in black and
weepers, for all the world like an undertaker at a funeral.&nbsp;
He turned his eyes&mdash;or what should have been his
eyes&mdash;full upon them both.&nbsp; And then your aunt went
faint, and I believe your uncle did no better.&nbsp; Anyhow, when
they came back to their senses, carriage and coachman were
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did it mean, Frampton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s more than I can tell you, Master
Ronald.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s fairly puzzled all of us.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve bothered my head times over to try and
piece it together, seeing it meant no harm to them, but only to a
lot of folk they&rsquo;d never seen or heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did that come about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we got to Paris, we put up at one of them big
hotels&mdash;I forget the name of it.&nbsp; And one day he and
she were going up <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>to their rooms in the lift.&nbsp; Just as they were
stepping aboard of it, they looked chanceways at the man who
managed it, and I&rsquo;m blessed if it wasn&rsquo;t the same
coachman as had driven that there carriage up to the door at
Broadwater.&nbsp; They were that frightened that they stepped
back, and the lift went up without them.&nbsp; And well it was
they did so, for something or other went wrong with the hauling
gear, and every soul on board of it was killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you know, Master Ronald, why your uncle
won&rsquo;t have that carriage never touched.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
got it into his head, and you won&rsquo;t get it out again, that
it was sent to save his life.&nbsp; All I can say is that, if
that&rsquo;s what it did mean, old Nick carries on his business
in a queer, roundabout kind of way.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>Not many days after Frampton had imparted to us his
sensational story, we were told to expect a visit from the family
lawyer.&nbsp; Ronald and I always hailed his visits with
delight.&nbsp; He was one of those cheery individuals <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>whom boys can
chum with.&nbsp; In age he must have been nearly seventy-five,
but hale and hearty still: entering into our amusements, never
minding our noise, and tipping us when he left with a liberality
that appalled our uncle.&nbsp; Ronald and I would have put him
down for fifty.&nbsp; But boys do not recognise the gradations of
age.&nbsp; To them a man seems definitely old at fifty, and live
as long as he may after that, years will add nothing to the
mystery of his age, if only he keeps young in heart and
interests.&nbsp; At sixty, seventy, or even eighty, he will in
their eyes be fifty still.</p>
<p>As a matter of course Ronald and I were told to put in an
appearance on the day of his arrival.&nbsp; The unvarying order
of the programme was that, after he had had a few words with our
uncle, we two should form his escort in a progress round the park
and outlying farms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So your uncle still cherishes the old Crofton
coach,&rdquo; he said, as we passed the outhouse tenanted by the
family ghost.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder he cares to keep
it,&rdquo;&mdash;almost Ronald&rsquo;s own words to Frampton, the
coachman&mdash;from which it was clear he had never heard <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of our
uncle&rsquo;s visitant, nor did we venture to enlighten him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about it, Sir?&rdquo; asked
Ronald, in the eager tone of one who had by no means lost hope of
solving the mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, I&rsquo;ve <i>ridden in it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald&rsquo;s face was a study.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ridden in it?
actually <i>ridden</i> in that coach?&nbsp; And did you, Sir,
<i>did</i> you see the devil?&rdquo; he continued
anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Frampton says he always drives
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, Ronald.&nbsp; And, by the way, my lad, I
wouldn&rsquo;t, if I were you, introduce his name quite so
familiarly into your conversation.&nbsp; Frampton must be
cautioned, Fred, as to what he tells the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t exactly say that, Sir,&rdquo;
continued Ronald, willing to justify his friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
called him old Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a trifle better.&nbsp; Anyhow, I
didn&rsquo;t see him, though I can&rsquo;t say honestly that my
ride was a pleasant one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d been staying here with
old Crofton, just before he sold the place to your uncle, and I
had business too to transact with Thorpe of Thorpe Hill.&nbsp; As
luck would have it, all the carriages here <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>were in use
but this one.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t in the state it is now, but
it was out of date and uncomfortable even then.&nbsp; However, it
took me there all right.&nbsp; It was on the way back that I had
my adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had barely composed myself to sleep with the
consciousness of having dined too well&mdash;Thorpe never stinted
his guests&mdash;when I was roused by an uneasy feeling that I
was not the sole occupant of the carriage.&nbsp; The interior was
lit up by a weird, fantastic light that came and went, rose and
fell, like the glow that throbs over a brick-kiln or a blast
furnace.&nbsp; After all, it may have been only the reflection of
my own cigar which I had instinctively kept alight during my
short nap.&nbsp; From out the border-land which separates sleep
from waking, I saw two figures on the opposite seat.&nbsp; For a
time I studied them with hardly more interest than I should the
figures in a pantomime, till it was forced upon me by their wild
gesticulation that this was no pantomime enacting for my benefit,
but a veritable tragedy of life and death.&nbsp; The one figure
shrank cowering in a corner of the carriage; the other stood over
it with uplifted hand.&nbsp; But no voice or sound proceeded <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>from
them.&nbsp; Only on the hand of one, the figure that crouched and
trembled, I recognised the famous Thorpe emerald&mdash;as the
family lawyer I knew it well&mdash;while the other that stormed
and threatened might have passed for old Crofton himself, in so
far as youth of twenty can anticipate the form and lineaments of
seventy-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The details had hardly had time to shape themselves
within my brain, when the light died out.&nbsp; I heard&mdash;or
fancied I heard&mdash;a short, sharp gasp, an inarticulate cry
for mercy, and the carriage drew up before the gate of
Broadwater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night after dinner we were subjected to a close
cross-examination by our uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys have told me your surprising story, Mr.
Roberts.&nbsp; May I ask how it is I never heard it from you
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Mr. Heyward, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have heard it now if my little friend Ronald
hadn&rsquo;t rushed me into telling it by his burst of
eagerness.&nbsp; You might have said I&rsquo;d been dining too
well&mdash;as indeed I had&mdash;and that isn&rsquo;t exactly the
thing to recommend a family lawyer.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;ve got my
reputation at your mercy, young gentlemen.&nbsp; <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>For, of
course, it <i>was</i> the dinner&mdash;a nightmare of some kind,
no doubt.&nbsp; Though I&rsquo;m bound to say I never had a
nightmare, either before or afterwards, that was half so vivid
and real.&nbsp; It was quite the worst quarter of an hour I ever
passed in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not so much of a nightmare as you
suppose,&rdquo; rejoined the uncle, and then proceeded to narrate
his own experiences.&nbsp; I remember thinking how much better
Frampton told the story than he did, in spite of his rather
unorthodox language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! that alters the whole question.&nbsp;
Corroborative evidence with a vengeance&mdash;evidence that one
might almost take into court.&nbsp; For even if <i>you</i> had
been dining not wisely, your sister hadn&rsquo;t, I know.&nbsp;
Anyhow, we three staid gentlefolk could create a pretty sensation
with our three independent testimonies.&nbsp; To think that a
belief in ghosts should be forced upon me at my age!&nbsp; Why I
shall be dragged next into believing the village
legend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; I never even heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Ronald&rsquo;s old carriage is somehow mixed up
with the quarrel between Thorpe and Broadwater&mdash;that it
stands in the way <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>of their family union.&nbsp; So you see, young
gentlemen, where you&rsquo;ve got to look for a wife as soon as
the carriage is gone.&nbsp; But it doesn&rsquo;t look like it
yet.&nbsp; Old Thorpe&rsquo;s dead, and the house shut up, and
the only survivor of the family is on the point, they tell me, of
marrying her cousin.&nbsp; Above all, you guard the old carriage,
Heyward, as if it were a priceless heirloom.&nbsp; But perhaps
you are right; it isn&rsquo;t your business to get rid of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>So the old carriage mouldered on in the coach-house, and its
net-work of cobwebs grew grimier each day.</p>
<p>How the spiders maintained themselves was a mystery, for no
fly could have run the blockade of the window, even if the
inducement had been greater.&nbsp; At last Ronald and I wove a
legend around them in our turn, which terrified us more than did
the carriage itself.&nbsp; We decided that, after long years of
mutual slaughter, the victory had rested in the end with two or
three hoary monsters, who had ensconced themselves within the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>framework of
the ruined carriage, from which they looked out upon the solitude
they were creating.&nbsp; Little by little the uncanny idea grew
upon us till, regardless of all probability, we fancied we could
see their eyes peering out of the darkness.</p>
<p>More than once we made illicit expeditions at midnight in the
hope that we might find the ghostly coachman cleaning and
repairing his equipage for another sortie.&nbsp; But we could see
nothing.&nbsp; If either of us had gone alone, the result might
have been different; we should have seen, or pretended to see,
many matters of interest.</p>
<p>November was, as a rule, our month of storms at Broadwater,
though February often ran it close; and, in the year that
followed upon Frampton&rsquo;s story, a gale broke upon us on the
third of the month that beat the record of our times for
violence.&nbsp; We had not been without warning of its
coming.&nbsp; The sea had been &ldquo;crying out&rdquo; at
intervals&mdash;sure token that the storm had paused to gather
breath, bidding the sea take forward its message to the
shore.</p>
<p>Not when the gale is at its height&mdash;at any rate along our
coast&mdash;can you best realise <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>the grandeur of the sea.&nbsp; Study
it rather on one of these quiet days of warning, when you can
trace a wave almost from its inception, till it curls over at
your feet with a dull roar, regular as the boom of a minute gun,
and audible for miles inland.</p>
<p>Lashed into foam, and its voice drowned by the wind, it parts
with much of its majesty, and becomes merely a symbol of turmoil
and unrest.&nbsp; What it gains in wildness, it loses in
self-control, like the seething rapids of Niagara before they
compose themselves into dignity prior to the final plunge.</p>
<p>Then came another and a final warning.&nbsp; It was one of
those rare sunsets which leave an imprint on the memory for
life.&nbsp; Not a sunset in which conflicting colours are fused
into each other by soft and subtle gradations&mdash;these we see
often and soon forget&mdash;but one of war and discord; when
colours, the most antagonistic, meet without blending, and
produce effects that would be called crude and coarse upon a
painter&rsquo;s canvas.</p>
<p>On a background of unvarying crimson, black and purple clouds
were projected, clean cut in outline, and solid, to all
appearance, as the hull of an Atlantic liner that was cleaving <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>her way
across the sea beneath them.&nbsp; The sea itself borrowed its
colours from the sky, but jealously guarded them from encroaching
on the beach beyond, which shone white as silver in the unnatural
glow.&nbsp; Beyond it still, the valleys and hills that rose
behind Broadwater were painted a dark and luminous green, on
which a few scattered homesteads stood out in clear and startling
relief.&nbsp; For the moment distance was annihilated, and a step
or two, or so it seemed, might have compassed the mile of space
that separated us from our own house door.</p>
<p>A sunset like this, following upon a &ldquo;crying&rdquo; sea,
can never be misread by the dwellers on our coast.&nbsp; It warns
every fisherman that he must haul his lerret to the very summit
of the ridge, and every Coastguard station along the dreaded Bay
that it behoves them to be awake and watching.&nbsp; But it was
not till midnight that the storm broke upon us.</p>
<p>Our faith in the old house was strong.&nbsp; It had outlived
so many storms, and the gale of &rsquo;24 must have been worse
than this, or so we kept saying for mutual encouragement.&nbsp;
But it was hard to believe it, and the comfort was quickly
followed by a disquieting thought <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>that each year, as it passed, left
the chimneys older and less capable of resisting the
pressure.&nbsp; We were disquieted, too, for others; we knew well
by experience what a night like this might bring us from the
sea.&nbsp; Times upon times, in similar gales, we had been
hurried to the beach by signals of distress, and had helped the
Coastguard, sometimes in saving life, oftener in furthering that
painful recall to life which is more agonizing to witness than
death itself.</p>
<p>Happily there came to-night no appealing cry.&nbsp; Even if it
had pierced its way through wind and rain, those whom it summoned
could only have watched and waited for one of those strange
freaks by which the sea now and again elects to spare a human
life.&nbsp; At the height of the gale, when gust upon gust
followed each other with ever increasing fury, we were still
seated in the drawing-room under various pretences.&nbsp; Ronald
and I said openly that we were afraid of venturing our lives in
the upper rooms, just under the chimneys.&nbsp; Our uncle jeered
at our cowardice, but stayed where he was.&nbsp; &ldquo;The noise
would prevent my sleeping,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but, as for
danger, I&rsquo;d as lief sleep in the garrets as <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>anywhere;
only the servants&rsquo; beds ain&rsquo;t as comfortable as my
own.&nbsp; The old house&rsquo;ll last our time yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if in answer to his boast, the gale made another defiant
howl.&nbsp; It was answered by a dull crash, followed by a
continuous roar of falling materials&mdash;followed again by a
dead silence that was audible above the rush of wind and
rain.&nbsp; It took us only a few minutes to satisfy ourselves
that the fabric of the house was safe.&nbsp; It was a chimney
stablewards that had gone, crashing through a hay loft and lumber
room right down on the top of our ghostly carriage, and clearing
Broadwater of spiders for the period of our lives.&nbsp; Even the
uncle himself could find no plea for extending his protection to
a mass of shivered fragments.&nbsp; If the powers of darkness had
destroyed their own handiwork, or failed in ability to protect
it, there was no reason to suppose that the hand of man would be
more successful.&nbsp; So the fiat went forth&mdash;not, I
believe, without great searching of heart on the part of our
uncle&mdash;and carriage and cobwebs, and even the stable itself
were swept away, and, as Bunyan says, I saw them no more.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo;
said a quiet, sweet voice at my elbow, as Ronald and I were
watching the departure of the last load of materials.&nbsp; And,
turning, I saw before me the woman who was to be the guiding star
of Ronald&rsquo;s life, yes, and my own life too.&nbsp; She was
little more than a girl then&mdash;only a few years older than
Ronald himself&mdash;with a great calm truthfulness in her eyes,
and the air of one who had already known sorrow, and been
refined, not hardened, by the experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;I am glad it&rsquo;s
gone.&nbsp; And now we can be friends.&nbsp; It has been so
lonely for me at Thorpe ever since my father died, and I have so
wanted to make friends with you; only that old carriage stood in
the way.&nbsp; It was silly, no doubt, to be so much afraid, but
then I am Scotch&mdash;and the Scotch you know are very
superstitious,&rdquo; she added with a smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Besides, ever since I can remember anything, I&rsquo;ve
been told that the old carriage meant mischief and trouble
between Thorpe and Broadwater.&nbsp; It is true, no doubt, that
an ancestor of mine did die in it, and that all sorts of ghastly
rumours were current as to how he met his death.&nbsp; <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>But nothing
ever came of them, and it was commonly assumed that he died of
heart disease; he had certainly been ailing for years
before.&nbsp; Thank heaven! the very scene of the crime&mdash;if
such it were&mdash;has been swept away at last.&nbsp; And it is
pleasant, isn&rsquo;t it? to recommence our life&rsquo;s
friendship here where it was wrecked.&nbsp; Though I fear we
shan&rsquo;t meet often as yet, for my husband that is to be
lives abroad, till I can persuade him to give up his post and
settle down with me for good in the dear old home.&nbsp; But you
<i>will</i> be my friends, won&rsquo;t you, for
always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand in pledge of her friendship.&nbsp; And
we shall be friends, I think, &ldquo;for always.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
like the old-fashioned phrase.</p>
<p>Besides, it was her own.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>On the
Racecourse at Bayview</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Ronald&rsquo;s birthday, and
the day fixed for the Races at Bayview&mdash;an unlucky
coincidence, for he always showed a keen spirit of enterprise on
that particular morning.&nbsp; He was now fourteen, and looked a
trifle older owing to his splendid physique.&nbsp; Even in the
nursery visitors had christened him the &ldquo;Infant
Hercules.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Viking he was in miniature, with clear
blue eyes and short, crisp hair, carrying with him an atmosphere
of suppressed fun that, dangerous as it might prove, was a
certain guarantee against dulness or want of spirit.&nbsp; He had
behaved himself beautifully for an entire month.&nbsp; But I
distrusted him to-day.&nbsp; He had never seen the races, and had
constantly signified his intention of doing so.&nbsp; So when his
uncle said to him at breakfast, &ldquo;You are not to go to the
races; they are destructive of morality, especially to a boy of
your age,&rdquo; and Ronald <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>winked at me across the table, I felt
sure he intended to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; he said respectfully&mdash;&ldquo;and I
suppose you won&rsquo;t go either.&nbsp; Of course they
can&rsquo;t do you any harm at your age; but they can&rsquo;t do
you any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happens, Ronald, I shall go&mdash;just to make
sure that you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Besides, I think it a good
principle that elderly people should be seen doing things which
they forbid to their youngsters.&nbsp; Unquestioning obedience is
a fine thing.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t follow that because I allow
myself a cigar to quiet my nerves, therefore you should smoke who
don&rsquo;t know what a nerve means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir: of course it doesn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;and he
winked again.</p>
<p>For myself, I distinctly intended to go to the races, seeing
that I was past the age at which my uncle feared their contagion;
though neither was I old enough to plead the principle which he
had so astutely paraded on his own account.&nbsp; And so I
went.</p>
<p>Ronald had left the house soon after breakfast&mdash;for a
ride (he said)&mdash;and, as I saw nothing of him on the
racecourse, I was comfortable in the belief that for once he had
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>obeyed
orders.&nbsp; When the races were nearly over, a little stable
boy came up to me and touched his cap:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horse, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>By Jove, it was Ronald.&nbsp; He had borrowed Dick the
groom&rsquo;s livery, and had had a fine time of it, he told me,
in that unconventional attire.</p>
<p>Just then our uncle rode up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now stand away,
Fred, and don&rsquo;t be seen talking to me, and I&rsquo;ll show
you some rare sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your horse, sir?&rdquo;&mdash;this to our
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind if you do, and I&rsquo;ll have
a stroll with Fred here till it&rsquo;s time to go
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a lounge along the course, chatting with friends and
criticising the horses, we came back to where we left
Ronald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the uncle, as he
re-mounted, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a shilling for you.&nbsp; A lucky
dog you are, too, for it&rsquo;s got a hole in it, I see.&nbsp;
Good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When dinner was over that evening, the uncle waxed genial over
a bottle of &rsquo;75 Margaux.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;d a capital
day&rsquo;s racing, Ronald.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m almost sorry you
weren&rsquo;t with us.&nbsp; Next year, all well, my boy,
I&rsquo;ll take you myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Thanks, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and he winked the third
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way, you haven&rsquo;t lost a shilling,
sir, have you?&nbsp; I picked up this one while you were at the
races.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a lucky dog, sir, if it does belong to
you, for it&rsquo;s got a hole in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verdict: <i>Acquitted</i>, <i>but don&rsquo;t do it
again</i>.</p>
<h3><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>On the
Sands</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Broadwater</span> was fearfully dull on a
Sunday, so I came over from Bayview where I was staying, that
Ronald and I might help each other in getting through the
day.</p>
<p>It was a blazing afternoon in August, and the park, shut in by
hills, shimmered in a haze of heat.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
stand this,&rdquo; said Ronald.&nbsp; &ldquo;Air I must get
somehow, and, as it&rsquo;s not to be got nearer than the sea,
we&rsquo;ll walk to the shore in search of it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
rather hard on you, to be sure, who&rsquo;ve done the walk once
already.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s better than lounging about here,
where it&rsquo;s too hot to speak or think; and, at any rate, we
shall see the trippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened, most unluckily, that just as we reached the pier,
an open air service had begun.&nbsp; Of course they had chosen
the hottest corner possible for it; a nook sheltered by the
masonry of the pier, which carefully excluded every breath of
wind that might be <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>travelling to us from the sea.&nbsp; But, despite the
heat, it was a temptation to mild excitement that Ronald found it
impossible to resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good as the nigger minstrels, but better than
nothing,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; So we joined the throng of
listeners.&nbsp; It was the usual audience, the devotees (mainly
women) forming the inner circle, in close proximity to the
preacher and the harmonium.&nbsp; Next came the half-hearted,
weaker vessels, who separated the former as by a wall from the
irreverent throng of idlers who laughed and talked and smoked on
the outside fringe.&nbsp; The preacher was a man of the ordinary
type, only a little stouter, a little more flaccid and even more
illiterate than usual.&nbsp; Where do they come from, these
preachers?&nbsp; Are they men who think they have a call or a
gift? and are they accepted for the office on their own
valuation?&nbsp; Certainly they are not chosen for any capability
that can approve itself to the impartial hearer.</p>
<p>The present representative of the school was enlarging, when
we came up, upon the demerits of the publican.&nbsp; Ronald,
after a few minutes, began to fume and fret.&nbsp; But he behaved
for a while excellently well, though <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>I could hear him muttering words in
an undertone distinctly uncomplimentary to the preacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is publicans like these&mdash;the scum and
refuse of Jerusalem&mdash;that are represented in this town
to-day by the inn-keepers, barmen, and pot-boys, who an hour or
two hence will be serving many of their fellow
creatures&mdash;many, I fear, of this audience&mdash;with drink,
to the ruin of their lives here and of their hopes of salvation
hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; shouted Ronald, &ldquo;he
wasn&rsquo;t an innkeeper at all; he was a tax-gatherer.&nbsp;
Every schoolboy knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence that followed was awful; every eye was turned upon
the boy, and it was a strain upon my loyalty to remain at his
side, and not then and there renounce his acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he wasn&rsquo;t, wasn&rsquo;t he, young man?&rdquo;
said the preacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, as you seems to know more
about the Bible than I do, perhaps you&rsquo;ll step up here and
take my place.&nbsp; Kindly tell us, if <i>you</i> please, out of
<i>your</i> superior knowledge, what he was, and why he was
called a publican if he was a tax-collector; and why a poor
collector of rates, <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>who only did his duty, is held up to our scorn and
reprobation; yes, our <i>reprobation</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This word
he regarded as a crushing climax.)</p>
<p>To my complete and indescribable confusion, Ronald, nothing
loth, accepted the challenge with delight, and the next moment
was standing on the platform addressing an appreciative
audience.&nbsp; What a sermon he gave them!&mdash;lasting without
a pause or break for exactly half-an-hour; every thought reasoned
out, and closing with a peroration of consummate eloquence.&nbsp;
By a clever feint he had diverted the text of the preacher to one
on the Pharisee and the Publican, making a scathing attack on the
Pharisaism of the day, which went to church, and gave its alms
openly and never in secret; which paid its way and kept the
conventional commandments, and neglected (as of little count) the
weightier things of unselfishness and love.&nbsp; &ldquo;A day is
coming when it will matter nothing where we lived, nor in what
occupations, nor amidst what circumstances, but only how we
wrought, and in what spirit we suffered.&nbsp; Be the thing you
say; be unselfish, in your own poor way, to your friends and to
your home, and to the world about you; that is worth <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>ten thousand
sermons and a hundred thousand Articles of Religion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A dead silence followed as he stepped down from the platform; he
had left a charm upon us that it seemed sacrilege to break.&nbsp;
Then came a word or two.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a wonderful
boy!&mdash;a second Spurgeon; with all his eloquence and none of
his irreverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summat worth hearin&rsquo;, I calls it; how he did
pitch into they bloomin&rsquo; aristocrats.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come
and hear ye, young master, whensomdever you holds forth
agin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I never!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was with this
ungrammatical aposiopesis that I started, so soon as I could find
breath to start at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where on earth, Ronald, did
you get it all from?&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy had come back to me
looking as cool as a cucumber, and highly delighted with the
sensation he had created.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell, Fred,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but
it was a sermon of Vaughan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; We are made to analyse
his sermons at school, and say them afterwards for repetition
lessons.&nbsp; So when that old donkey fell foul of the publican,
I had one handy you see, on that very subject, and I thought it a
pity not to fire it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Surely,
I thought, he&rsquo;ll be satisfied now, and I tried to draw him
away from the crowd, who were becoming a trifle too much
interested in our name and identity.&nbsp; But no; not a bit of
it.&nbsp; The excitement was full upon him still.&nbsp; So up he
went to the harmonium (they had now started a hymn), and looking
over the shoulder of the performer (she was a pretty girl of
eighteen) he began to sing as lustily as the best of them.&nbsp;
By degrees his arm, I saw, began to steal about her waist, and,
fuss and fidget as she might, she was powerless to help
herself.&nbsp; Her hands were occupied with the keyboard, and her
feet with the blower, and with her voice she had to lead the
singing.&nbsp; So he had her at his mercy, and hugged her
disgracefully, while she, poor girl, was powerless to
resist.&nbsp; The audience all thought she was his sister, and
highly commended him, it was clear, for the countenance and
support he was giving her.</p>
<p>While the last line of the last verse was being sung, the
temptation became too strong for resistance, and Ronald stooped
down and kissed her&mdash;an action which touched still further
the sympathetic heart of the audience.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;A dear, good young feller that, as ever I
see&rsquo;d&rdquo;&mdash;said an old lady in my immediate
neighbourhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only wish as how he were a son of
mine; a preachin&rsquo; that fine, for all the world like the
Bishop, and a&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; arter his sister so
prettily&mdash;and a nice young girl she is too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this exploit he slipped across the circle and joined me,
and a minute later&mdash;with hot and blazing cheeks&mdash;I was
thankful to find myself round the corner, and well on the way
home before the throng of listeners had begun to disperse.&nbsp;
I felt, indeed, as must that Bishop, who, to oblige a small girl
younger in years than in experience, condescended to ring at a
street door, and was rewarded with the advice, &ldquo;Run!
<i>run</i> for yer life! they&rsquo;ll knock the &rsquo;ead off
yer shoulders if they catches ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wonder what he
elected to do? pocket his dignity and run? or rely upon his
clerical attire to see him through?&nbsp; In any case our anxiety
would be more protracted.&nbsp; What if the escapade should reach
our uncle&rsquo;s ears?&nbsp; However I was spared this
climax.&nbsp; The story of it got wind in the servants&rsquo;
hall, as all stories do; but the servants were far too loyal to
Master <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Ronald to betray him, and so it never made its way up
stairs to the drawing room.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But the career of that preacher was ended&mdash;in
Bayview.</p>
<h3><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Our
Rector</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had two, if not three,
celebrities in our village.&nbsp; The Rector is dead; the Clerk
is dead; the Professor still lives.&nbsp; But, independently of
this claim to our respect, let us give precedence to the
Church.</p>
<p>Less than fifty years ago the services in a parish not ten
miles from one of our well-known watering places were
done&mdash;or left undone&mdash;by surely the queerest cleric of
his time.</p>
<p>A grand old man he was in person&mdash;tall, and venerable as
Bede himself, with the most benevolent of faces and the most
silver of silver hair.&nbsp; Fit to be an archbishop, so far as
appearances went, but most unfit to have the charge of the
hundred souls&mdash;there were no more of them&mdash;committed to
his trust.</p>
<p>To these he ministered, or (as I have said) failed to
minister, on Sunday mornings; for often as not the services,
stipulated for at the price of &pound;75 per annum, were left
unperformed on the shallowest of pretexts.&nbsp; It might be <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the weather;
it might be that he was indisposed; often, I fear, it was from
sheer disinclination.</p>
<p>To the hamlet that clustered close round the church it was a
matter of comparative indifference.&nbsp; They never believed by
anticipation in the service till the bell was actually sounding;
and his henchman (clerk, sexton, choirmaster and gravedigger in
one) had strict orders to withhold this summons till the Rector
himself was actually in view.&nbsp; But to our party, who lived
two miles away, the question of service or no service was a
serious one.&nbsp; It meant hesitation in starting, and
reluctance to risk the chance&mdash;provocation, too, even to my
long-suffering father, when he found the church door barred, and
a south-wester brewing, in the teeth of which we had to struggle
home over a barren down, unsupported by the nutriment, mental and
moral, on which we had calculated.&nbsp; But the service, when it
did take place, was a queerer experience by far than the service
foregone.&nbsp; The orchestra would have been the despair of
Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; It consisted of a single flageolet, blown
by the wheezy old sexton&mdash;one Joseph Edwards by name.&nbsp;
We did not <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>even boast of a serpent&mdash;instrument immortalised by
Mr. Hardy for its volume of tone in supplementing
deficiencies.&nbsp; Now the flageolet is a pet aversion of mine,
and I can forgive Nebuchadnezzar many of his iniquities for
having (so far as we know) excluded it from his band.&nbsp;
Indeed, musicians themselves would seem to be ashamed of it, for
they have re-christened it, I am told, by a humbler name.&nbsp;
But I was careful not to betray my feelings to my friend Joseph,
and listened patiently while he enlarged on the capabilities and
melodiousness of his pet instrument.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not but what
I&rsquo;m getting a bit wheezy (he&rsquo;d often say to me), and
can&rsquo;t make the flourishes as onst I could.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;tis may be better as it is.&nbsp; They quieter tunes are
belike more godly.&nbsp; Anyhow the choir&mdash;poor
souls&mdash;got right puzzled among my turns and quavers, coming
in here, there and no how at the finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, praise it as he might, the flageolet is the worst
instrument possible to constitute an orchestra; especially when
played as Joseph played it.&nbsp; It gave out a series of squeaks
and counter-squeaks&mdash;punctuated and accentuated by his
wheezes rather than <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>by the requirements of the tune.&nbsp; Indeed, a boy
learning the bugle, or a Punch and Judy panpipe, would have
discoursed more decorous music.&nbsp; To me the panpipe and the
flageolet seem nearly akin; only the flageolet is the more
powerful instrument of the two, and Punch is more exacting than
we were in the choice of an executant.</p>
<p>Once, as a special favour, I was invited by Joseph to attend a
choir practice.&nbsp; It was before his hand or, I should say,
his breath had lost its cunning; and it took place on this
wise.&nbsp; An hour before service (which on this occasion was
actually realised) Joseph took his stand in the reading desk,
flageolet in hand, while a group of apple-cheeked
cottagers&mdash;fishermen mainly, and plough-boys&mdash;grouped
themselves in my father&rsquo;s pew below.&nbsp; In one point at
any rate Joseph had anticipated the ritual of later days; he
repudiated all women from his choir.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Taint no
place for &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say; &ldquo;I wonder what
&rsquo;postle Paul &rsquo;d think, if he could ha&rsquo; heard
they two women at S. Matthew&rsquo;s screechin&rsquo; out
&lsquo;O &rsquo;twas a joyful sound to hear&rsquo;&mdash;and none
of us, let alone the choir, privileged to put in a joyful sound
along wi &rsquo;em.&nbsp; If women <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>baint allowed to preach in Church,
stands to reason that they baint allowed to sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now boys, turn to &lsquo;Aurelia,&rsquo; and go for to
remember that we sing the whole on&rsquo;t right through this
time.&nbsp; Last time as ever we did it some on you took to
skipping and one sang one verse and t&rsquo;other the next,
whereby I had to blow myself nigh faint to hide your
discordance.&nbsp; And mind ye too, sing &rsquo;en slow, not as
if you wanted to get shot on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All went well at the first rehearsal, for Joseph played the
air distinctly and without disturbing flourishes&mdash;only with
an intolerable drawl, mindful in all probability of
&ldquo;passon&rsquo;s&rdquo; injunctions; of which more anon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well sung,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;you be a good choir
when you be so minded; and well instructed, too, though I says it
as didn&rsquo;t ought to.&nbsp; Now then, we&rsquo;ll see what ye
can do when I puts in the flourishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a change for the worse, and what had been a
melancholy dirge became a haphazard scramble for notes, each boy
seizing on the one that he could detect among the enveloping
flourishes, regardless whether it was the same note that had
found favour <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>with his neighbour.&nbsp; In the end the hymn became a
sacrilegious fugue, devoid of time, harmony or sequence.&nbsp;
Yet Joseph was never disquieted at the result.&nbsp; On the
contrary, he regarded it as a tribute to his skill, addressing
his choir at the finish as a general might address his
discomfited troops: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your best, and none
of us can&rsquo;t do no more.&nbsp; Better luck at church-time,
and this I do say, that &rsquo;tis few players can overlay a
melody as I can wi&rsquo; flourishes and expect them as sings it
to pick out the tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to return to our Rector.&nbsp; The fun began (I write,
remember, as a boy of ten) with the First Lesson.&nbsp; When the
time for it approached, great preparations were seen to be in
progress.&nbsp; Our benevolent Archbishop retired into the
recesses of the reading desk (a high, square pew, scarcely to be
differentiated from our own) and disposed his lunch in orderly
array upon the sill overhanging my father&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
And, to give time for its consumption, a boy was summoned from
the congregation&mdash;usually it was his own son, a curly-pated
lad of thirteen&mdash;to discourse the Lesson.&nbsp; Manfully he
grappled with the difficulties and hard names of the Old
Testament&mdash;<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>sticking and halting at nothing, and making a record of
false quantities and mispronunciations that I have never heard
beaten during a twenty years&rsquo; experience of the average
undergraduate.&nbsp; Meanwhile his father lunched peacefully,
careless what havoc he made with the Kings of Israel and
Judah.&nbsp; But woe betide the boy if ever he tried to skip a
name.&nbsp; A guttural rebuke issued from the depths of the
reading desk: &ldquo;None of that, Jack; go back, my lad, and try
it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his greatest delight of all was to hear Jack struggling
with the genealogy in St. Luke.&nbsp; A series of chuckles issued
from the corner where the old man lay ensconced, that gathered in
volume with every fresh fall; and when the boy, hot and
discomfited, retired from the fray, there was a pause in the
proceedings till the old man had recovered himself sufficiently
to resume his functions.&nbsp; His luncheon meanwhile had been
progressing steadily, not without the gurgling sound of something
comforting to facilitate digestion.&nbsp; It puzzled me for years
to discover the <i>raison d&rsquo; &ecirc;tre</i> of this
extraordinary meal, knowing as I did that an hour later he would
be dining with one of his cottagers, after careful preliminary <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>enquiry as to
which house could offer the most attractive fare.&nbsp; Only
quite lately, long after the idea of luncheon had been
stereotyped upon my brain, I found out that the so-called
luncheon was, after all, no luncheon at all, but only a retarded
breakfast.&nbsp; Our Rector being a late riser, and having a
five-mile walk before him, could find no opportunity of taking it
in comfort till he had reached the haven of the parish reading
desk.</p>
<p>A cigar was the indispensable accompaniment of the second
Lesson, during which period its fumes could be seen ascending
like &ldquo;curling incense&rdquo; to the blackened rafters of
the roof.&nbsp; Indeed, the only thing that ever really shattered
my father&rsquo;s equanimity was the sight of its reeking end,
projected over his head from the sill of the reading desk, where
the Rector had reluctantly placed it while he applied himself to
the requirements of the &ldquo;Benedictus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the flageolet sounded the key note of the first hymn, the
Rector regarded it as the signal of a temporary relaxation.&nbsp;
He was for a time off duty, and the cigar was again in
requisition.&nbsp; But in fine and balmy <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>weather, he
found the atmosphere of the church too close for its
enjoyment.&nbsp; It &ldquo;gathered sweetness from the open
air.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, attired in surplice, stole and bands, our
Rector strolled out into the churchyard&mdash;giving us pleasant
little vista-views of his enjoyment as he passed and re-passed
the windows of the aisles.&nbsp; That it might be enjoyed in
perfection and unto the end, the hymns selected were inordinately
long.&nbsp; But, if fate was against him, and the wind light, and
the cigar drew slowly, he had no false shame in appearing on the
chancel steps to announce with all the dignity of a formal notice
that the last two verses of the hymn would be repeated.&nbsp;
After which he disappeared into the churchyard again.</p>
<p>The sermon was to me, as a boy, full of the most delightful
interest.&nbsp; It had an infinity of anticipation.&nbsp; No one
knew what was coming&mdash;least of all the Rector himself.&nbsp;
We felt stimulated by the chance of any and every
possibility.&nbsp; A clergyman of the strictest sect of the
Evangelicals, he always preached in a surplice.&nbsp; (It was in
the days, remember, when the Geneva gown was the badge of that
school, and the sign of a high church cleric was barely appearing
above the horizon).</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>But I
sadly fear that our Rector was influenced by no question of
principle or non-principle; I cannot, I think, be wronging him if
I infer that his preference for the surplice was due to sheer
indifference or indolence.</p>
<p>Then came the always exciting task of moving the immense Bible
from the reading desk to the pulpit.&nbsp; He regarded it, I
think, almost in the light of a fetish, and certainly, so long as
I knew him, would never have attempted a sermon with any smaller
and less trustworthy guide.&nbsp; He balanced the enormous volume
in his right hand, and, with his left hand on the rails, steadied
himself as he made the painful and perilous ascent.&nbsp; The
hope, I fear, of us boys was that the book would one day slip
from his hand and imperil the head of the clerk beneath, who was
now no longer choirmaster, but, like a Roman flute player, had
crossed over to his proper seat and resumed his duties beneath
the pulpit.&nbsp; But the hope was never realised, and I have
felt ever since that my life has lacked something in
consequence.</p>
<p>The choice of his text was the longest part of his
sermon.&nbsp; The Bible was opened haphazard, as though he
intended to execute <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>a sort of <i>sors Vergiliana</i>.&nbsp; But so casual a
method was quite unsuited to the dignity of our Rector.&nbsp; The
pages were turned and re-turned; whole chapters were read and
carefully studied, and, after a quarter of an hour of this
preliminary investigation, a text was given out, that for glaring
irrelevance and disconnection with everything else could never
have been surpassed if he had taken it at sight.&nbsp; A name out
of a genealogy&mdash;the Christian name
Mary&mdash;Tophet&mdash;the daubed wall&mdash;pillows for all
armholes&mdash;are among the subjects that I distinctly remember
were selected for our edification.&nbsp; But of the treatment
alas! I remember nothing&mdash;nothing then, and certainly
nothing now, when I would give &pound;50 to trace the exact
process of his reasoning.</p>
<p>The last sermon I ever heard him deliver was on the text,
&ldquo;And there shall be no more sea&rdquo;&mdash;an unwise and
disquieting subject for a congregation, most of whom came of a
race of fishermen, and gained their living from the element which
he so confidently annihilated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there baint no sea, then &rsquo;tis no place for
I,&rdquo; I heard a man say to his neighbour as <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>he passed out
of church; &ldquo;and sakes alive, where be &rsquo;en going to
get their fish from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was our Rector.&nbsp; Not reverent or discreet, you will
say, in his capacity of priest.&nbsp; No, but a kindly, genial
old man; devoted to his parishioners, if not to his duties;
clever too, and companionable in society, and inexhaustible to
the boys of the parish in the matter of marbles and
gingerbread.</p>
<p>It is with affection that I recall him, for, in spite of his
eccentricities, and perhaps because of them, I loved him
well.&mdash;<i>R.I.P.</i></p>
<h3><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Echoes
from an Organ Loft</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pale fingers moved upon the keys,<br />
The ghost hands of past centuries.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Joseph&rsquo;s flageolet to one of the finest organs in
England&mdash;from the scene of &ldquo;our Rector&rsquo;s&rdquo;
ministrations to a building that could have swallowed up his
church and his school room and all the house property in his
parish&mdash;was a startling transition for a boy of
fourteen.</p>
<p>I wonder how often, during my first experience of a cathedral
service, my thoughts travelled back to the tiny hamlet in the
west, with its ruined chancel on which the Atlantic had spent its
rage, and its few cottages straggling on and up behind an avenue
of elms, to where the new church, safe in a sheltered paradise of
its own, looks down compassionately upon the wreckage of the
past.</p>
<p>In times to come I got to know every nook and corner of the
great organ loft at K.&nbsp; <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>It was built in those large minded
days before architects had conceived the fatal idea of
economising space.&nbsp; Ascending by a broad staircase that rose
with the dignity of an inclined plane, you came out upon a
plateau, roomier and more comfortable than many a London
flat.&nbsp; The sanctum of the organist&mdash;indeed, the huge
instrument itself&mdash;were little more than incidents of the
loft.&nbsp; There was a chamber for the wife of the dean, and
another chamber for the wife of the organist, together with a
library for the Church music; and still there was room in it for
blind man&rsquo;s buff&mdash;when the choristers could get the
chance.</p>
<p>The organ itself might have been a mile away&mdash;so little
did you hear of it.&nbsp; In this respect the loft resembled the
deck of a battleship, where the men who work the guns hear least
of the explosion.&nbsp; Only a few muttered growls from the big
pipes that lined the walls on either side, or burrowed in the
caverns underneath, suggested the proximity of sound.&nbsp; The
crash of the full organ was delivered at a point far above your
head, somewhere among the shadowy outlines of the roof.</p>
<p>The space allotted to the dean&rsquo;s wife on <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the other
side of the organ was less comfortable than ours, but far more
interesting.&nbsp; The floor outside her enclosure was broken by
yawning chasms to give the great pipes breathing room; and though
they were of wood, and spoke, as wooden pipes should speak, in
hollow muffled tones, they must, I fancy, have confused her
devotions and raised a small hurricane about the nape of her
neck.</p>
<p>Linking the present to the past were the names of by-gone
choristers, carved in schoolboy fashion upon the old oak panels,
who had sung their last note a hundred years ago&mdash;it might
be in this very gallery.&nbsp; It was easy to picture them
passing and re-passing still through the trap door which opened
at our feet&mdash;a white robed procession of the voiceless
dead.</p>
<p>An organ loft is a delightfully irresponsible place from which
to take part in a service, especially when the instrument is a
large one, well removed from the congregation on the top of a
screen&mdash;above all, when you do not happen to be the
organist.</p>
<p>I would not for an instant be understood to imply that the
sense of aloofness necessarily engenders irreverence.&nbsp; On
the contrary, many <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>of the most solemn hours of my life were passed within
the recesses of the great organ at K., and my friend the organist
might have been a pattern to the congregation in true devotional
spirit.&nbsp; But the necessities imposed by a choral service
afforded him little opportunity for a devotional attitude, while
he would have been more, or less, than human if he had not
utilised our isolation to impart to me pleasant little details
regarding the progress of the service.&nbsp; These would be
interrupted at intervals by parenthetical instructions whenever
he wanted help in the management of his stops.</p>
<p>A reminiscence of an organ-loft monologue would read something
as follows: &ldquo;<i>Draw the Gamba</i>, <i>please</i>.&nbsp;
How flat that boy Robinson&rsquo;s singing; and oh! those
<i>h</i>&rsquo;s of his!&nbsp; <i>Principal</i>, <i>please</i>,
<i>and now the mixtures</i>.&nbsp; Green&rsquo;s getting shaky in
his top notes; he only looked at that upper G.&nbsp; <i>Take
care</i>; <i>you put in that coupler before I had finished the
bar</i>.&nbsp; What a nuisance it is!&nbsp; I shall never get a
boy like him . . .&nbsp; The finest hymn written, don&rsquo;t you
think?&nbsp; (They were singing Stainer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saints of
God&rsquo;) . . . and &lsquo;Aurelia&rsquo; is the second
best.&nbsp; (Well done! Joseph, I thought; <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>you&rsquo;re
in it after all.)&nbsp; Get me Wely&rsquo;s Offertoire in G, will
you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s poor stuff, but the people will have
it.&nbsp; <i>The Oboe</i>, <i>please</i>, <i>for the air</i> . .
.&nbsp; And now for the scramble . . .&nbsp; <i>Turn over in good
time</i>; <i>I can see ahead of me</i>, <i>but I can&rsquo;t see
through the page</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he dashed into the finale
at the hurricane pace that alone makes the thing endurable.&nbsp;
Even he couldn&rsquo;t talk till it was done.</p>
<p>Sometimes we were interested in events that were proceeding in
the world beneath us.&nbsp; &ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the man
reading the fifteenth for? it&rsquo;s the sixteenth that&rsquo;s
the lesson for the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s
Henderson,&rdquo; would be my reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;He always
chooses a fine chapter to show off his voice and elocution.&nbsp;
If he&rsquo;s hauled up for it, he&rsquo;ll say he did it by
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion we were favoured by a reader, fresh from the
study of Aristophanes, with the startling announcement that the
First Lesson for the day was taken from the Book of
<i>Ecclesiazusae</i>.</p>
<p>One day I heard voices in the choir beneath.&nbsp; I knew,
before I saw the speakers reflected from the mirror in front of
me, that they were two limp figures in blue serge and <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>coal-scuttle
bonnets.&nbsp; The strident tones were unmistakeable, the
product, in so far as the human throat can compass it, of a long
and careful assimilation of the clash of the cymbals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rare fine buildin&rsquo;, this,&rdquo; said one,
&ldquo;and what a hinstrument!&nbsp; I only wish we &rsquo;ad it
in our place; draw a sight better than drums and cymbals,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And a deal noisier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; answered the other,
&ldquo;but, for all that, I wouldn&rsquo;t exchange with that lot
to get it.&nbsp; They deans and chapters and canons, and heaven
knows what they calls theirselves, aye, and the bisshup hisself,
is that sunk in ignorance and self-conceit that they can&rsquo;t
see the right way; no, nor never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally, but very rarely, matters went wrong in our own
department.&nbsp; The water that fed the hydraulic gear failed,
or was cut off at the main, and the organ &ldquo;went out&rdquo;
in the middle of an anthem.&nbsp; One afternoon in November it
clouded over so suddenly that we could hardly see our faces in
the organ loft.&nbsp; Worse luck still, the matches were damp,
and till I could be back with some more, Dr. H. had to guess at
the anthem as best he could.&nbsp; I am <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>not musician
enough to know how he surmounted the difficulty, but I suspect
that the choir that day must have been treated to an amount of
improvisation to which they were wholly unaccustomed from an
organist who, as a rule, played what he had to play, and rarely
indulged in vagaries.</p>
<p>But our worst disaster was of earlier date.&nbsp; Bildad the
Shuhite blew the organ.&nbsp; He had received that name because
he cleaned shoes in a corner of the Close.&nbsp; It was in
prehistoric days before hydraulic gear was dreamed of in
connexion with the organ.&nbsp; As luck would have it, Bildad
fell sick, and had to supply a deputy at the last moment.&nbsp;
Dr. H. studied the man carefully, mistrusting, I think, his
intelligence.&nbsp; But his answers were satisfactory, though I
thought with the Doctor that he protested too much.&nbsp; Anyhow,
the service was due, and we had no time to waste on our
fears.&nbsp; The singing began, but the organ was irresponsive,
and, hurrying to the back of the loft, I found our deputy-blower
contemplating with blank stolidity the mechanism at his command,
and pleading with an injured air, &ldquo;Sir, I am a&rsquo;
waitin&rsquo; for you to begin!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>One day
I was laboriously extracting discords from the great instrument
with Dr. H. at my elbow, when a gentle voice at our side asked
for permission to try the instrument.&nbsp; What a delight it
was, after the horrors I had been perpetrating, to see the long
fingers charm out the melody, till they drifted at last into the
chords of Chopin&rsquo;s great march.&nbsp; Surely, I thought,
the composer must hear and welcome such a perfect realisation of
his wondrous dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charrlie, me boy, thry the pey-dals,&rdquo; came a
voice from below, with the raciest and most captivating of
brogues.&nbsp; It was my first introduction to Ireland&rsquo;s
great musician&mdash;Sir Robert Stewart&mdash;and his still
greater pupil, composer in prospective of the <i>Requiem</i> and
<i>Revenge</i>.</p>
<p>At our next interview the Professor of the future gave me a
friendly lecture on Wagner, emphasising his teaching the while by
illustrative passages, which he played, I remember, in thick
woollen gloves, of which he hadn&rsquo;t troubled to divest
himself, being pressed for time and the organ loft none too
warm.&nbsp; The mechanism of the organ, I am bound to add, was
old and antiquated&mdash;not <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>as it is in these days, when the
notes speak if a fly sits upon them, or you venture to sneeze in
their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>I have made acquaintance with strange scenes in an organ
loft&mdash;an organist of surpassing ability playing through a
service when he was drunk, but certainly not incapable.&nbsp; Yet
a deputy sat by him, ready to take his place in case he should
prove unequal to retaining his seat at the instrument.&nbsp; I
have seen a fight between two choristers who had been sent to
fetch music for the choir.&nbsp; It began on this wise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can lick you &rsquo;ead over &rsquo;eels in &rsquo;oly
&rsquo;oly &rsquo;oly,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; The taunt was not
to be endured by a chorister of spirit, so &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
said the other; and they had fought it out to the bitter end at
the back of the organ before ever Dr. H. was aware that the
battle was in progress.&nbsp; I have seen courtship
too&mdash;ending, as all courtship should do, in
matrimony&mdash;while the organist played unsuspiciously a soft
and dreamy accompaniment.&nbsp; And I have seen heroism
too&mdash;grand as any displayed upon a field of
battle&mdash;when my friend came from his sick bed and played
through a service magnificently while the death dew gathered <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>on his
face.&nbsp; And I coveted, as I never coveted before or since,
the divine gift of music, which would have enabled me to spare
him his long and patient hour of martyrdom.</p>
<p>And, at the end, he played the Dead March, never knowing that
it was for himself he played it, while a furious thunder-storm
raged over head, and the roll of the thirty-two-foot pipes was
drowned by reverberating peals.&nbsp; As the final chords came
crashing from his hands, he said to me, &ldquo;Handel must have
written it, I think, to an accompaniment like this.&nbsp; And yet
the modern school of organists would have us leave out the
drums!&nbsp; I shall never care to play it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And three weeks afterwards he was dead.</p>
<h3><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Fighting the Cholera</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> it an escapade, I wonder? or
was it something greater and grander?&nbsp; There are, I suppose,
escapades good and bad; heroic and unheroic.</p>
<p>One evening I was tidying up Ronald&rsquo;s room at
Cambridge.&nbsp; We were both of us in residence now: I as an
M.A., while he had just entered as an undergraduate.&nbsp; He was
as studiously untidy as I was the reverse, and, but for me, his
room, artistic as it was, would always have looked like a boudoir
that had been used over-night for a tap-room.&nbsp; Pipes,
tobacco, and matches met the eye everywhere, scattered among
vases of flowers and ferns; no two sheets of the <i>Times</i>
were together in one place; &ldquo;Esmond&rdquo; lay cheek by
jowl with &ldquo;Tom Jones&rdquo; (the former, I was glad to see,
the better worn), while there was more than a suspicion that his
surplice was in use as a bed for a litter of kittens.</p>
<p>Ronald himself lay at his ease upon the sofa, watching&mdash;I
cannot say with interest, <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>but at any rate without
prejudice&mdash;my improvements for the worse.&nbsp; But I roused
him at last.&nbsp; In replacing a small box of Italian olive wood
I knocked off the lid, and an aggregation of articles
unimaginable were scattered on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! stop that, old man,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be losing or breaking some of my most
cherished possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are they, Ronald?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a
small crucifix and a missal (you haven&rsquo;t turned Roman
Catholic, have you?) and any amount of rings&mdash;most of them
brass&mdash;and, by Jove, a lock of hair!&nbsp; Is the last a
love token?&nbsp; It looks uncommonly like the relic of another
escapade.&nbsp; Did it belong to the girl who played the
harmonium on the beach at Bayview?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know
you&rsquo;d got so far as that.&nbsp; Besides, her hair was
light, if I remember.&nbsp; Out with it, old man, and clear your
conscience by confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have done with your jokes, Fred; you&rsquo;re the last
fellow to chaff like that if you knew the rights of it.&nbsp;
And, if I must tell you, I must.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t want
you to know of the matter; it looks too much like boasting.&nbsp;
However, you find out everything I do; so <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>I may as well
tell you all about this, before you hunt it up for yourself in
some underhand way, or make a tale out of it that isn&rsquo;t the
true one.&nbsp; You know Richards, Fred; the man my uncle made me
travel with last autumn&mdash;to see the world, as he called
it.&nbsp; I never liked the fellow, and always thought him a cad;
but I didn&rsquo;t know till then that he was a coward as well as
a cad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought him both,&rdquo; was my reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taormina in Sicily was one of the places we stopped at:
the loveliest spot that you could dream of, if you dreamed your
hardest.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve never been there, have you?&nbsp;
Well: the town itself is a fair day&rsquo;s walk up hill from the
sea, and Mola&rsquo;s another day&rsquo;s walk above that; by
which time you&rsquo;ve nearly reached the clouds&mdash;only, as
it happens, Sicily doesn&rsquo;t boast of any.&nbsp; But you
needn&rsquo;t go higher than Taormina for the loveliest view on
earth.&nbsp; They may talk of seeing Madrid, Seville, Naples, and
a hundred other places, and then dying contented&mdash;why,
there&rsquo;s none of them that&rsquo;s a patch on
Taormina.&nbsp; Sit down in the proscenium of the old theatre,
facing Etna, with the Straits of Messina and the foot of <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>Italy laid
out like a map on your left: and you can do without another view
for the rest of your natural life.&nbsp; The only objection we
found to it was that in September of last year it was most
awfully hot, and Taormina is pestiferous enough to be a Turkish
settlement.&nbsp; It is worse, I think, than the old town of
Granada, which is perhaps the filthiest place that I know in
Europe.&nbsp; The cholera, too, was about last year, especially
in Italy; and, if it <i>did</i> cross the Straits, Taormina was
ripe and handy for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we&rsquo;d been there for a week or so it
<i>did</i> come with a vengeance.&nbsp; First a suspicious case
or two, then a case that was not suspicious at all, and then it
fell like a thunderbolt on the town.&nbsp; Richards was off
directly, and with him everyone in the place who could afford to
go; so the poorer people, with their old priest, who stuck to his
work like a man, had it all to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it looks like boasting, but I didn&rsquo;t like to
run.&nbsp; Besides, I had come there for a fortnight, and I was
fond of the place and the view and the old theatre&mdash;so why
go?&nbsp; Anyhow I didn&rsquo;t budge, and did what I could to
help the old man in his difficulty&mdash;it was little <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>enough.&nbsp;
However, I had heaps of money, and they wanted that more than
anything.&nbsp; And he taught me something about
medicine&mdash;what little he knew of it; though, after all,
nothing but stimulants at one stage and opium at another seemed
to do them the slightest good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a time it was!&nbsp; I pray that I may never stand
face to face with cholera again.&nbsp; Overhead, a sky like
brass, and, veiling the town, a dusky, steel-blue haze, almost as
palpable as gauze: the distinctive colour (I&rsquo;ve been told)
of a cholera atmosphere.&nbsp; They died like flies, crowded in
their close, evil-smelling dwellings, though we lighted fires in
the streets to clear the air; an idea I borrowed, I believe, from
&lsquo;Old St. Paul&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late one evening I hurried from a sick room to get a
breath of air in the theatre below.&nbsp; My friend, the old
priest, was there before me.&nbsp; This was an unusual
coincidence, as he scarcely ever gave himself a moment&rsquo;s
rest.&nbsp; Yet he might have done so now, for in ten days&rsquo;
time the disease abated as rapidly as it had begun.&nbsp; And
besides, he had organised a band of fairly efficient helpers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good evening, signor,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You see <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>me in my church; for I find in it the same relief that
my brethren in the cities find within the walls of a
cathedral.&nbsp; To me it would seem a poor exchange&mdash;for
what cathedral built by man could match this view?&rsquo;&nbsp;
As he spoke he pointed through the ruined arches to where Etna
towered in the distance.&nbsp; Surely the noblest drop-scene ever
fashioned by the hand of nature, and not unworthily framed by the
artist who had designed the theatre.&nbsp; Between the ruined
columns on the left a steamer, environed by a little group of
feluccas, made a series of dissolving views as it overtook and
passed them on the sea below.&nbsp; But I saw he had some trouble
on his mind over and above his care for his patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take courage, padre mio.&nbsp; The worst is
over.&nbsp; That shroud of steel-blue mist is lifting day by
day.&nbsp; I should like to know what causes it.&nbsp; I believe
if we had had the power of gauging it, its changes would have
made no bad register of the death-rate in the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are right, my son; the worst <i>is</i> past;
and, thanks mainly to you, I have been enabled to do my duty
while it lasted.&nbsp; Without you I could have done
little.&nbsp; Take <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>an old man&rsquo;s thanks, signor, on behalf of those
who are left and those who are gone.&nbsp; Neither the one nor
the other will ever forget you, here or in the world that holds
them now.&nbsp; Yet I could almost wish that you had never
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I wish, at any rate&rsquo; (speaking with more
vehemence than his wont), &lsquo;that you had not brought with
you that false-hearted friend of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You mean Richards.&nbsp; Yes, he is a coward to
run away like that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Worse, far worse.&nbsp; You know little Ninetta
well, who lives at your lodgings up the hill&mdash;the prettiest
girl in Taormina they call her, and I fancy they are right.&nbsp;
She is down with the cholera&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you know
it?&nbsp; Taken this morning, and, unless I am wrong in my
judgment, it is one of the worst cases we have
had&mdash;hopeless, I should say, from the very first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poor little Ninetta!&nbsp; It does seem hard;
taken, too, just when the disease was dying out.&nbsp; But what
has Richards to do with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The confessional is sacred, my friend.&nbsp; But
it may be that, in this one case, the <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>cholera has struck in
kindliness.&nbsp; Though I am sorry he should be away when he
might have made her end more peaceful.&nbsp; Even when I left her
to come and find you, she was perpetually calling for him.&nbsp;
Put her off with excuses; it won&rsquo;t be for long.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let her think him a coward as well as a
villain.&nbsp; If you weren&rsquo;t a heretic, I would absolve
you beforehand for any necessary evasion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may be sure I&rsquo;ll do my best.&nbsp; The
evasions won&rsquo;t lie heavy upon my conscience.&nbsp;
Goodnight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no hope for her, as he had said.&nbsp; During
the early stage of her illness she was always asking for
him&mdash;wondering why he stayed away&mdash;for I obeyed the
priest&rsquo;s injunctions, and never told her he&rsquo;d been
coward enough to run.&nbsp; As she got worse, she began to
wander, and, from having seen us so often together, she would
confuse him with me; and, at the last, was perfectly happy so
long as I was with her; calling me by his name, and thanking him,
as she imagined, for all his care and kindness to her.&nbsp; The
lock of hair that puzzled you is hers.&nbsp; She gave it to me
just before she died (she had nothing else to give, poor girl) in
the belief she was giving it <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to Richards.&nbsp; And then, quite
quietly, still in the belief that he was with her, and that it
was his hand and not mine that she was holding, she died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you have the story, Fred, such as it is.&nbsp;
All the other things were given me by the villagers&mdash;the few
of them, that is, who lived&mdash;all except the missal, which
came from my old friend the priest.&nbsp; It was his most
cherished possession; given, I believe, in the hope of converting
me.&nbsp; Well, if conversion would make me another such as he
was, I wouldn&rsquo;t say no to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I ever see him again, I wonder?&nbsp; Some day,
Fred, you and I will go and hunt him up.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Ronald&rsquo;s Courtship</h3>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">HAVE</span> been looking through all
my old letters to-night.&nbsp; It is a strange sensation in these
days, when the shuttle spins so fast, to re-read the letters
between childhood and manhood.&nbsp; All details seem softened,
viewed through the haze of time.&nbsp; Human nature was (or so it
seems to one) so much kindlier then than now.&nbsp; What pleasant
ghosts are raised by these old letters; what touches that one
missed in them in the hurried, feverish days when they were
written!&nbsp; In so very many cases, too, the hands that penned
them are still.&nbsp; I have come upon one from Ronald, written
when he was just twenty-five.&nbsp; It is singularly devoid of
romance, compared with many of the others, and has &ldquo;brisked
me up&rdquo; considerably, when I was verging on melancholia.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Fred</span> (it
runs),</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall want you for a wedding a month hence.&nbsp;
Guess the name of the happy lady.&nbsp; No more escapades
from&mdash;Yours respectably,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Ronald</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Who was
she? and how had he managed it? were the questions I asked myself
at the time.&nbsp; Somehow or other, I couldn&rsquo;t imagine
Ronald proposing to his lady-love in a conventional,
Christianlike way.&nbsp; True, time had sobered him
considerably.&nbsp; He was now a handsome young fellow, living
quietly and sedately with his uncle at Broadwater; not easy to
recognise as the lad who had discomfited an itinerant preacher,
and played the stable-boy on the race-course at Bayview.&nbsp;
But the spirit of Bohemianism dies hard, and I was possessed with
the idea that, even in the act of &ldquo;placing himself&rdquo;
for life, Ronald would make opportunity for a final fling.&nbsp;
He was having a really bad time of it with his uncle, and, in
spite of occasional outbursts, when the Viking blood got the
better of him, had been fairly amenable to discipline.&nbsp; The
old man, I know, must have been a constant thorn in his flesh;
very selfish, and very dogmatic on all points, especially
politics.&nbsp; If he could have reasoned logically himself, or
have listened to reason in others, he would have been less
objectionable.&nbsp; But he formed his opinions on grounds as
strictly illogical as does the average woman, and, to <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>do him
justice, never abandoned them.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a grand speech that was of Gladstone&rsquo;s
yesterday, Ronald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so, sir?&nbsp; It seemed a trifle
commonplace to me in comparison with Dizzy&rsquo;s
reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&nbsp; Dizzy&rsquo;s no speaker at all compared
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear him, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;and don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have read his speeches, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&mdash;and I hope I never may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was his recognised line of argument (Heaven save the
mark!) on all topics.&nbsp; Yet to differ from any of his
conclusions was a most serious offence, which Ronald in time
learned how to avoid.&nbsp; His own part in a conversation became
limited to a series of characterless phrases&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir,&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course,
sir&rdquo;&mdash;which passed muster as entirely
satisfactory.&nbsp; Occasionally, it is true, they were flavoured
with a salt of sarcasm, but as this only rebounded harmlessly,
without piercing his uncle&rsquo;s pachydermatous hide, the peace
was seldom broken between them.&nbsp; Outsiders were less
merciful.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;Growing a trifle dogmatical is Heyward,
isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;&mdash;one club member would say to
another&mdash;when a theory, accepted obediently by my
uncle&rsquo;s household, had been thrust a little prematurely
down a stranger&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there:
he&rsquo;s getting on in years&mdash;sixty, I should say, if
he&rsquo;s a day&mdash;and we shall all of us like our own way
then.&nbsp; Indeed, youngsters like it too, as a Master of
Trinity found with his junior Fellows.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not one of us
is infallible,&rsquo; he said to them, &lsquo;not even the
youngest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a gentlemanly face, was old Heyward&rsquo;s, though, if
you happened to be a judge of faces, you would probably have
added &ldquo;a weak one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, and&mdash;No.&nbsp;
Not strong, certainly, in intellect or knowledge, though the
features are scored with deep-cut lines, that might be mistaken
by the casual observer for traces of reflective thought.&nbsp;
But lines traced by the hand of intellect ennoble and brighten
the face, even in the act of carving it; these had only soured
and embittered it.&nbsp; Such strength as they show is the
strength of a dogged persistency, which clings to an opinion,
right or wrong, because it admits no counter argument, and always
carries its point by a process of blank obstructiveness.&nbsp;
But <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>each
victory thus gained is of the nature of a defeat, narrowing and
confining the soul still more within its self-imposed limits,
deafening it to the interests of an outer world, and to the joys
and sorrows of humanity at large.</p>
<p>His sister was a tall, angular woman, with thin, compressed
lips and a cold, grey eye, betokening a far more active and
aggressive will.&nbsp; But probably no two people were ever more
entirely in harmony, till Ronald sowed dissension between
them.&nbsp; Even dissimilarities, in their case, became points of
agreement.&nbsp; For instance, the uncle read much and forgot all
that he read, while she read nothing and had consequently nothing
to forget.&nbsp; Then again, they were united in their devotion
to comfort, for which each required the other.&nbsp; Wider forms
of attachment they ignored and dispensed with, as unprofitable
for the furtherance of the main issue.&nbsp; Friends, servants,
animals, who were found detrimental, simply disappeared without
comment, as unobtrusively as did the obnoxious teachers in Madame
Beck&rsquo;s famous <i>pensionnat</i> in the Rue Fossette.</p>
<p>In the art of &ldquo;nagging&rdquo; our uncle was supreme,
bearing out Sarah Grand&rsquo;s theory that women are nowhere in
this province, <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>which has been reckoned peculiarly their own.&nbsp;
Curling himself up gracefully in his favourite armchair, and
lighting a cigar, he would prepare himself to enjoy it.&nbsp;
Sometimes the attack would be sudden and wanting in delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald, I wish you could manage to be down in time for
dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ronald, be it observed, had been five
minutes late, but yet five minutes prior to its announcement by
the butler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tie was so infern&mdash;intolerably hard to fasten,
sir.&nbsp; I must get a <i>Jemima</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A <i>Jemima</i>!&rdquo; shouted the
uncle&mdash;scandalised at the idea of Ronald contemplating the
introduction of some rustic handmaid&mdash;&ldquo;What on earth
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hand-made tie, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The pun is yours,
old man, not mine.&nbsp; Besides, the uncle wouldn&rsquo;t have
seen it, even if he&rsquo;d given me the chance.&mdash;R.)</p>
<p>A mollified pause of ten minutes.&nbsp; The next time he would
preface his thrust with a feint, to throw Ronald off his
guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a wonderfully nice young fellow Carter is.&nbsp;
Gets himself up as if he were living in town.&nbsp; I <i>do</i>
like to see a fellow wear <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>a tall hat on Sunday; it&rsquo;s far
and away more respectable than a round one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald was incorrigible in this respect, and became as the
deaf adder.</p>
<p>Five minutes&rsquo; grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How that fellow Stanton did talk at dinner; one
couldn&rsquo;t get a word in edgeways.&nbsp; By-the-by, I think
<i>you</i> talk a little too freely, Ronald, to men older and
wiser than yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Semper ego auditor tantum</i>?&rdquo; muttered
Ronald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you are saying, Ronald?&nbsp; I do wish you
would speak up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I would only listen in future, sir.&nbsp;
<i>Nunquamne reponam</i>?&rdquo; (the latter <i>sotto
voce</i>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are&mdash;muttering again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only saying I wished I could write a book,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Heyward couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to her brother in
this particular department.&nbsp; She lacked altogether the
delicacy of &ldquo;finesse&rdquo; which is essential to its
development, and, strange to say, possessed in a high degree by
people of feeble intelligence.&nbsp; But she seconded him bravely
in cases where temper and determination would serve its
purpose.&nbsp; <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>Here it was to advocate stronger measures, and hers was
the master mind.&nbsp; She was not without a suspicion that time
and reiteration had blunted the edge of her brother&rsquo;s
innuendo.&nbsp; When therefore she was called in for
consultation, Ronald knew that it betokened a definite and
concerted campaign.&nbsp; He would be sent to Coventry, or fed on
roast pork, and specialities that his soul abhorred, or (but for
his age) have been whipped.&nbsp; Finally, and in the last
resort, his pocket money would be docked&mdash;a punishment that
was known to be effective.&nbsp; Spending little upon himself, he
had always a band of pensioners who were dependent on him for
assistance.&nbsp; So it was through them that he could most
surely be reached.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seething the kid in the
mother&rsquo;s milk,&rdquo; as we are told in
&lsquo;Kenilworth,&rsquo; is an occupation that offers a wide
field to the ingenuity of the inventive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two&rsquo;s company and three&rsquo;s none,&rdquo;
muttered Ronald, when, on entering a room suddenly, he found an
animated conversation drop suddenly into silence, while an echo
of his own escapades and iniquities lingered in the air.</p>
<h4><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>II</h4>
<p>A strange and melancholy life it was for a lad of
Ronald&rsquo;s temperament; a strange and incongruous
fellowship:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For East is East, and West is West, and
never the twain shall meet&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it had in it one redeeming feature.&nbsp; Only a mile from
Broadwater, in the white house that nestles in the heart of the
valley, just visible to us over a depression in the lulls, lived
a young widow of twenty-eight&mdash;Ronald&rsquo;s dearest
friend, and his comforter and consoler whenever the monotony of
existence seemed almost intolerable to the lad just entering on
manhood.</p>
<p>The coalition between Ronald and Mrs. Thorpe was regarded with
extreme disfavour by the uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Making a milksop of
the lad,&rdquo; he called it sneeringly.&nbsp; But the villagers,
one and all of them, were emphatic in their praise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A nice couple they&rsquo;d make,&rdquo; said old widow
Denvers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only hope it may come off, and that I may
be alive to see it.&nbsp; And love each other they do already,
unless my old eyes deceive me.&nbsp; See how he follers her about
and well nigh wusshups the ground <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>she treads on.&nbsp; Why he&rsquo;d
be at Thorpe Hill all day, if only that old aunt of his
didn&rsquo;t watch him like a cat.&nbsp; Drat her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling of companionship had steadily grown up between
them.&nbsp; The almost daily meetings and constant interchange of
ideas had produced their natural result, and the companionship
that had at first been a pleasure had long become a
necessity.&nbsp; Yet, strange to say, neither had recognised the
fact.&nbsp; Ronald himself would have scouted the idea.&nbsp;
Possessed of not a penny in his own rights, and dependent only on
what his uncle allowed him, he would have ridiculed the notion of
asking the richest woman in the county to become his wife.&nbsp;
Indeed it was the deterrent influence of their relative positions
that had excluded the possibility from finding a place among the
contingencies of his life.&nbsp; Yet she it was, however
unwittingly, who was the cause of Ronald&rsquo;s last
escapade.</p>
<p>The idea had frequently occurred to him that she had inspired
his uncle with the nearest approximation to love of which his
nature was capable.&nbsp; Not according to the accepted
traditions of lovemaking, nor exhibited in a manner that would be
patent to the world at large.&nbsp; But <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>he showed her
attentions that he withheld from all other women.&nbsp; He would
enquire solicitously after her health, and the health of her
dogs, in huge Grandisonian phrases; above all, he would vacate
for her his favourite armchair, and waive her into it with a bow
of old-world politeness.&nbsp; (To his sister, who ruled his
household, the chair in question was rigorously debarred).&nbsp;
Then again, she was a Liberal in politics.&nbsp; Not that this
counted for much, because he maintained that women should be
allowed no politics at all, beyond presenting a feeble reflex of
the man who was nearest or dearest to them.&nbsp; Much as he
hated Conservatism, he would sooner have seen the wife of his
friend Jacobs pose as the rankest of Tories, than at variance
with her husband in a way so subversive of the relation of the
sexes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a blessing it is to get across here for a change
of air,&rdquo; said Ronald, flinging himself down on a chair in
Mrs. Thorpe&rsquo;s drawing-room, where she was arranging her
flowers for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter now?&nbsp; Is it the aunt
or the uncle who has ruffled you this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;Not so much the people as the atmosphere.&nbsp;
The air seems laden with small trivialities.&nbsp; I feel like
the man in &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; who lived in a
cloud of dust that he was constantly raising.&nbsp; Whereas life
ought to be lived on a breezy upland, with your face to the
sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand what you mean, though your
reminiscences of Bunyan are a trifle mixed.&nbsp; And perhaps the
dust is better for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, when it&rsquo;s of one&rsquo;s own
making.&nbsp; Now <i>you</i> haven&rsquo;t a scrap of dust in
your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure.&nbsp; Look at that piano.&nbsp;
Anyhow, you didn&rsquo;t come all this way so early in the
morning to treat me to a revised version of Bunyan&rsquo;s
allegory.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter, Ronald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the old man&rsquo;s jealous of me.&nbsp; He
says I&rsquo;m over here too often&mdash;that people are
beginning to talk, and all manner of rot.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m almost
sure he wants to marry you himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you&rsquo;re dreaming.&nbsp; Do you think
that I would abandon my independence, and all my advanced
theories on women, to adopt your uncle&rsquo;s musty,
antediluvian ideas?&nbsp; <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Not a bit of it.&nbsp; Why I&rsquo;d
sooner marry <i>you</i>, if the worst came to the worst, though
even that wouldn&rsquo;t suit me either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would suit <i>me</i>,&rdquo; muttered Ronald,
&ldquo;just down to the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uncle&rsquo;s sight had of late been failing him, owing to
some weakness or lesion of the nerve that no spectacles could
remedy.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, his favourite amanuensis
was Ronald; for, though I regret to say it, his sister&rsquo;s
spelling was occasionally defective, and his uncle was particular
above all things that his correspondence should be strictly
orthographic.&nbsp; Not that this characteristic could be imputed
to Miss Heyward as a fault, especially in these days, when even
Peeresses (I am told) have adopted phonetic spelling, and
orthography has been relegated to our village schools as the
symbol of a lower and less intellectual class.&nbsp; But the
uncle was conservative in everything but politics, and regarded
the innovation as a forecast of the nation&rsquo;s decadence.</p>
<p>One morning he called Ronald into his study, with a
thoughtful, pre-occupied air that betokened business of more than
average importance.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>&ldquo;Ronald, I&rsquo;m thinking of marrying&mdash;and
who do you suppose is my choice?&nbsp; A great friend of yours by
the way, Mrs. Thorpe.&nbsp; I like her amazingly; a most
well-bred woman, who will look famously at the head of my
table.&nbsp; Then again, she&rsquo;s got money, though it&rsquo;s
true I don&rsquo;t want it.&nbsp; And her property marches with
mine; and we&rsquo;ll enclose it all in a ring fence, and have
the finest estate in the county.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got a few
crotchets, I know, but they&rsquo;ll soon be ousted when
she&rsquo;s found a sensible man to advise her.&nbsp; I grant
I&rsquo;m a trifle old for her, but people think nothing of that
in these days when the fault is on the right side.&nbsp; What do
you say to it? a good idea, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good indeed, sir,&rdquo; said
Ronald&mdash;demurely, but doubtingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t very hearty about it, Ronald.&nbsp; I
expected you to jump at the suggestion.&nbsp; Indeed, I thought
you were a little gone on her yourself, and would have welcomed
her warmly for your aunt.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re across at her house
pretty well every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am; and I do like her very much.&nbsp;
Indeed, I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded marrying her
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&ldquo;Good Lord! if that doesn&rsquo;t beat
everything!&nbsp; A mere boy like you, without a penny in the
world except what you get from me&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not dead
yet by a long way, Ronald&mdash;<i>you</i> to be in love with the
richest woman in the county!&nbsp; God bless me!&nbsp; What are
the boys coming to?&nbsp; But there&mdash;it&rsquo;s
nonsense.&nbsp; Put it out of your head, my lad, and sit down and
write what I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter, when it was forwarded, ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mrs.
Thorpe</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I write on a subject that touches very nearly the
happiness of my future life (&lsquo;it touches mine,
R.&rsquo;)&nbsp; You must have seen, I imagine, how much I have
admired and loved you (&lsquo;my sentiments exactly R.&rsquo;);
nor can you be blind to the fact that no other woman occupies the
place in my esteem which has been wholly given to you
(&lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t have expressed myself better,
R.&rsquo;)&nbsp; I now offer you my hand and heart
(&lsquo;savours of the complete letter writer, but true
notwithstanding, R.&rsquo;), together with all my worldly
possessions (&lsquo;&pound;50, all included, R.&rsquo;)&nbsp; You
know, I fancy, my ways and habits as no other woman can know them
(&lsquo;too well by half, R.&rsquo;)&nbsp; My temper is equable,
and I am, I think, companionable (&lsquo;query? R.&rsquo;)&nbsp;
My nephew Ronald will continue to live with us; you know him well
(&lsquo;I should just think so, R.&rsquo;)&nbsp; He is a really
good-hearted, well-meaning lad (&lsquo;thanks, <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>old man,
R.&rsquo;), but a little uppish at times, and thinks he knows
everything, like all the boys of the present day (&lsquo;I
retract my thanks, R.&rsquo;)&nbsp; But I fancy that you and he
will get on together (&lsquo;admirably, R.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall await your answer with impatience, and
anxiously hope it may be favourable (&lsquo;to me, R.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remain,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Your sincere admirer,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;A. <span
class="smcap">Heyward</span>.&rdquo;<br />
(&lsquo;Your loving friend, R.&rsquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer came next day, and was a crushing blow to my
uncle&rsquo;s hopes.&nbsp; She thanked him gratefully for the
offer, and regretted the disappointment her answer would cause
him.&nbsp; But her affections, she said, had long been bestowed
on his nephew, and she had lately had <i>reason to believe</i>
(italics at Ronald&rsquo;s request) that the feeling was
reciprocated.&nbsp; She was in a position, she added, to
disregard monetary considerations in the choice of a husband.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>There was strife within the gates of Broadwater on the
announcement of Ronald&rsquo;s engagement.&nbsp; The uncle was
furious at being supplanted this second time, and, to make
matters worse, the offender in this case was <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>the nephew of
his choice.&nbsp; So wroth was he that he nearly made me his heir
out of spite, and, for two or three days, my price rose
considerably on the matrimonial market.&nbsp; But, on giving
tongue to his wrath, he found himself without a supporter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A servile war had broken out&rdquo; (to quote from
&lsquo;Cometh up,&rsquo;&mdash;sweetest of all love stories, but,
Great <i>Dionysius</i>! what Greek!) and his sister was in a
state of open rebellion.&nbsp; It was she who headed the rising,
and with her went all the servants, which left our uncle in a
minority of one.&nbsp; She was, naturally enough, well pleased at
the progress of events, and anticipated with satisfaction the
continuance of her reign.</p>
<p>Ronald, so soon as his month&rsquo;s probation was ended, was
thankful to be received out of the fray into the sanctuary of
Thorpe.&nbsp; Not that he was at peace, even there.&nbsp; His
conscience gave him twinges, and I had a word to say to him on
the subject, and his wife had a word or two more.&nbsp; But it
was all for his good, and he had brought it upon himself by
treating matrimony (of all estates in the world) in a spirit of
graceless levity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>And
what of myself?&nbsp; Well, reader, I had lost my chance, or,
perhaps, willingly foregone it.&nbsp; All Ronald&rsquo;s pet
schemes had been safe in my hands, and I was little likely to
oppose the present one, when, almost from the first, I had
pictured its realisation, and seen how necessary it was to the
happiness and stability of his life.&nbsp; My
unselfishness&mdash;call it passivity if you will&mdash;carried
with it its own reward, for neither of the two was happy without
me, and Thorpe Hill practically became my home.</p>
<h3><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Judy,
or Retrieved</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Ronald</span> became her &lsquo;fidus
Achates&rsquo; and Lord High Almoner in all her acts of
charity.&nbsp; Occasionally, it is true, he misunderstood or
exceeded his instructions, as, for instance, when he went round
with a parcel of physic to a sick cottager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How be I to take &rsquo;m? did she tell
&rsquo;e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No: she didn&rsquo;t, but she meant all, I suppose,
unless it&rsquo;s written inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a large order, as the parcel contained castor oil, a
black draught, and six blue pills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which be I to take fust?&nbsp; She must ha&rsquo;
told &rsquo;e that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Ronald was at fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much, I allow, as the gentry do their
vittles&mdash;solids fust, and drinks atterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prescriptions, whatever the order observed in their
administration, answered to perfection, and Ronald&rsquo;s fame
was greatly magnified by the result.&nbsp; His drugs were in <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>high
request everywhere, and were reported to be &ldquo;powerfully
fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day his wife said to him, &ldquo;Ronald, would you like to
hear a project I have in hand for reclaiming a pet
drunkard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much: what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall give him a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! how will that help him?&nbsp; It reminds one
of a story in the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo; where somebody
with a crack-jaw name gives to somebody else&mdash;a porter, I
think it was&mdash;a lump of lead, promising it will make his
fortune.&nbsp; But he wisely declined to specify by what
particular method the charm would work.&nbsp; I think the man
weighted a fish-line with it, and caught a salmon with a diamond
in its mouth.&nbsp; But you can hardly expect your scheme to work
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see, Ronald.&nbsp; I read in a German story
book the other day how a dog had turned a man into an early riser
(I shall give you one, Ronald), and made him charitable, and
religious, and all the rest of it.&nbsp; Surely I can trust my
dog to reclaim a man from one single failing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see how he&rsquo;s going to do
it,&rdquo; said Ronald incredulously.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chances <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>are your
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> will take his dog the first day to
the nearest public-house.&nbsp; And, if he gets biscuits there,
as a nice dog is sure to do, he&rsquo;ll want no coaxing to take
his master there every day.&nbsp; And the last state of that man
will be worse than the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there is no worse possible in this
case.&nbsp; At any rate I have faith in my dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day a ragged little hound, called &ldquo;Judy,&rdquo;
was selected from the kennels at Thorpe Hill, and despatched to
the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> in question.&nbsp; Pure white
she was, and so small, that, at a shift, you could hold her in
the hollow of your hand.&nbsp; A veritable little mongrel, of
course, if ever there was one.&nbsp; Indeed, nothing but a
mongrel would have had the capacity for so delicate a
mission.&nbsp; For, as we all know, it is to the mongrel that we
look for intelligence and originality.&nbsp; The consciousness of
inherited merit is fatal to intellectual progress in an animal of
pedigree.&nbsp; Partiality&mdash;but only the most
prejudiced&mdash;might have called Judy a rough Irish
terrier.&nbsp; Only her ears didn&rsquo;t lop, but were carried
erect like a donkey&rsquo;s, and her legs were too long, and her
tail had an ugly &ldquo;kinck&rdquo; in it.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>Having abused her sufficiently for her personal
appearance, let me add that she had the sweetest and most winning
of faces&mdash;chiefly composed of eyes, which were so large in
comparison with the rest of her features that they seemed to
swallow them up, giving to the face, as a whole, the thin,
troubled look of premature age, which is so pathetic in any sick
animal.&nbsp; But Judy was far from being delicate, and enjoyed
to the full the zest and sparkle of life.&nbsp; With her head on
one side, and her ears pricked up, and attention bestowed on the
curl of her tail, a matter in which she was often negligent, she
would have matched the best of them as a study of arrested
life.</p>
<p>The two&mdash;the dog and the young reprobate she was expected
to reform&mdash;took to each other with all their hearts, and
soon became inseparable.&nbsp; But at first Ronald&rsquo;s
pessimistic prophecy seemed likely to be realised.&nbsp; True to
his natural instinct, her master took Judy at once to the nearest
public-house, and, as the biscuits due to an intelligent dog were
always forthcoming, Judy fell in entirely with her master&rsquo;s
view as to the direction their daily walk should take.&nbsp;
Ronald triumphed <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>maliciously but prematurely.&nbsp; For Judy was to be
recalled to her duty by a stern dispensation.</p>
<p>It happened one day, that, as she and her master were
starting, a troop of bicyclists came scorching down the hill, and
Judy, caught off her guard and losing her head, was run over, and
taken up for dead.&nbsp; After long days of anxious nursing she
was called slowly back to life, at least to a measure of
life.&nbsp; But the little dog&rsquo;s nerve was gone.&nbsp; From
that day forward no persuasion could tempt her to follow her
master along the public road.&nbsp; Warned by experience, she
dreaded bicyclists at every turning.&nbsp; Just so far as the
garden gate, and no further, she would follow him, and, with a
thin little feeble whine, plead almost in words for a change of
route.&nbsp; But the master&rsquo;s heart was steeled.&nbsp; It
was to be a conflict of will between them.&nbsp; And which was to
conquer? the dog or the man?&nbsp; For days and weeks the result
trembled in the scale.&nbsp; But the walk grew dreary apart from
his companion, and, going and returning, he was haunted by the
piteous whine.&nbsp; Then at last he succumbed.&nbsp; The
day&rsquo;s walk along the high road was exchanged for a run in
the nearest field or common, and Judy&rsquo;s heart rejoiced, and
her <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>spirit came again to her, and she became&mdash;almost,
but never quite&mdash;her natural self again.</p>
<p>Thenceforth the sympathy between these two was complete.&nbsp;
When Judy was ill again, almost to death, she was restful nowhere
but in her master&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; When he left the room,
her eyes would languidly follow him; when he came back, they
kindled to life again, breathed into by a new spirit; and when he
took her in his arms, all pain and disquiet ceased, and she lay
neither shivering nor moaning&mdash;lost to all feeling but the
satisfied assurance of his love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ronald, and how about my experiment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve beaten me,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a wonderful woman you are!&rdquo;</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In quo tam similem videbis Issam<br />
Ut sit tam similis sibi nec ipsa.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Martial</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was a very little dog with a very large soul, and all her
soul looked out of her eyes.&nbsp; No one whom she loved could
doubt <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>her love, when once her eyes had assumed their final
expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am your friend for life,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;and for death&mdash;and perhaps beyond
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the frivolous days of her youth she had snapped at the
knickerbockers of a chubby errand boy, and been promptly handed
over for punishment.&nbsp; But she broke from the executioner
under the indignity of the first stroke, and fled for refuge to
her master&rsquo;s bedroom, from which no efforts could dislodge
her.&nbsp; So, making the best of a bad business, he took to his
bed too for company&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Judy was deeply touched
by this practical sympathy, and it formed, I believe, the
historic ground-work of their life-long friendship.</p>
<p>Her pedigree was mixed.&nbsp; Her father was a white English
terrier of unimpeachable breed, who lived a sober, self-contained
existence, with no friend but the postman, whom he followed
conscientiously on all his rounds of delivery.&nbsp; Her mother
was the daughter of a &ldquo;King Charles,&rdquo; who had been
woo&rsquo;d and won by a fox.&nbsp; Fair and frail, she was
careless of the duties of life, and passed her time in eating and
sleeping, sleeping and eating&mdash;she is sleeping and eating
still, the latter with an <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>ever increasing appetite as the time
at her disposal grows less.</p>
<p>Judy repudiated <i>in toto</i> her maternal parentage, and
reproduced all the best characteristics of her father, combined
with a brilliant intelligence, and a far wider appreciation of
the sympathies of life.&nbsp; Her minor peculiarities were
borrowed from those of a cat.&nbsp; She sat like a cat, pounced
like a cat, and washed her face like a cat, using either or both
of her paws with a truly feline indifference.&nbsp; She could
climb bushes, too, hanging on by her teeth, to the detriment of
any unwary fledgling who presumed over confidently upon the
limitation of natural gifts.</p>
<p>Judy often came on a visit to Thorpe Hill, where she regularly
spent an hour after dinner in digging at the root of a favourite
beech tree, with the energy of a dog that is close on a
prize.&nbsp; From which I inferred that she was a truffle-terrier
in disguise, who would make all our fortunes, and set Matthew to
dig in her place till he blasphemed against Judy and the truffles
and me.&nbsp; But Matthew didn&rsquo;t put his heart into his
work, or realise the fact that Judy&rsquo;s credit was at
stake.&nbsp; And I always believed in her more than I did in
him.&nbsp; Later <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>on she justified my confidence&mdash;not, I admit, by a
discovery of truffles, but (better still) of a full-grown Roman
or Anglo-Saxon, crouching among his household divinities.&nbsp;
Judy was complacently proud of him as a very superior find, in
spite of Matthew&rsquo;s sneer, &ldquo;Tweren&rsquo;t triffles,
<i>I</i> knowed,&rdquo; and forthwith transferred her attentions
to a neighbouring tree, under which, for all I know, others of
his family may still be reposing.</p>
<p>It is humbling to admit that she was wholly devoid of tricks,
properly so called: partly because no one had troubled to teach
her any, and partly, I think, because she accounted it a waste of
time to try and acquire them.&nbsp; No one who studied her
thoughtful little face could doubt that she held higher and more
recondite theories of the responsibilities of life.</p>
<p>It was probably the same reason that led her to pass her days
in silence.&nbsp; Few objects she thought were worth the trouble
involved of setting in motion the harsh and cumbrous method by
which alone a dog converses&mdash;certainly not meat and drink,
and therefore she declined to ask for them.&nbsp; The prospect of
a walk, or the sight of a blackbird deriding <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>her from a
twig, formed the only exceptions and proved the rule.&nbsp;
Otherwise Judy would have been a canine Trappist.&nbsp; And her
reticence was the more remarkable, seeing that her mother passed
her time in futile and vociferous talking.&nbsp; Probable Judy
regarded her as an object lesson and a warning.&nbsp; She was
certainly disdainful of her noise.</p>
<p>But she had two natural gifts: you may call them tricks if you
will.&nbsp; She took her meals like a Christian, seated, or
rather kneeling, at table beside her master, with her paws
doubled under her knees.&nbsp; From this post of vantage she
would watch the whole proceedings of dinner with the curiosity of
an epicure.&nbsp; But dining on her own account offered little
attraction.&nbsp; The position of her paws, it is true, suggested
an attitude of devotion and gained for her the reputation of
saying grace before meat.&nbsp; But her own diet was strictly
limited to morsels of bread and biscuit, which she received with
indifference, and apparently without gratitude.&nbsp; It may be
that she dined in the night-time, as Amina did with the
ghoul.&nbsp; If so, I hope she selected more desirable
company.</p>
<p>She had one other peculiarity.&nbsp; I cannot <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>call it an
accomplishment, though it found her a number of admirers.&nbsp;
After studying you intently with eyes that looked you through and
through, as though she were appraising carefully your capacity
for friendship, she would raise a delicate fur-capped paw, and
lay it gently upon your nose&mdash;never anywhere else.&nbsp; It
was a favour accorded to no stranger, never indeed till she had
known you for months.&nbsp; For it was an oath of allegiance,
emblematic as the solemn transfusion of blood, and renewable on
occasion, if you cared to elicit it by staring her well out of
countenance.&nbsp; Yet it was trying to be reminded of the fact
when you were kneeling at prayers in full view of the servants,
simply because Judy regarded your attitude and surroundings as a
ceremonial specially designed for the re-enactment of her
vow.</p>
<p>Being a good friend, Judy was, by consequence, an equally good
nurse.&nbsp; The attributes of the two are indeed strangely akin,
if the latter be not a natural development of the former.&nbsp;
For in sickness, as in sorrow, there are times when a sympathetic
silence is a better restorative than more obtrusive
remedies.&nbsp; Her master found it so when Judy <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>nursed him
for four months at a stretch, sacrificing without a whine the
most brilliant summer on record.&nbsp; Cleverer than many a nurse
or doctor, she inferred his condition from certain changes of
face and expression, unappreciable by their less intuitive
faculties.&nbsp; Satisfied by a careful inspection that he was
for the moment improving, she would fall back on the pillow with
a sigh of satisfaction, till he was restless again, or till the
time came&mdash;she knew it as well as did the nurse&mdash;when
he had to be roused for his medicine.</p>
<p>Judy was sorry, I fancy, on her own account when the days of
her nursing were ended by her master&rsquo;s recovery.&nbsp; For
she never disguised her real sentiments, whether creditable or
the reverse, differing therein from the race of men, at whose
feelings and motives one can only hazard a bewildered guess.</p>
<p>Judy taught her master many things: among them how to win the
love of her community.&nbsp; Jealousy, it seems, is the family
failing.&nbsp; It is idle, she told him, to imagine that a few
scraps of half-hearted affection can claim the devotion of a
life.&nbsp; Careless, casual attentions may gratify an unexacting
dog; <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>they can never win his heart&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; It is
not for pity&rsquo;s sake, as some will tell you, that the
mongrel of the streets is attracted by preference to the vagabond
and outcast, who is as lonely as himself; rather, because he
feels that here at any rate is a field unoccupied, a mine of
sympathy that will royally repay for working.</p>
<p>But let the master of his affection form other and more
engrossing ties, and the love that he has given he will
infallibly withdraw&mdash;not hastily, capriciously, or for the
moment, but slowly, deliberately, and for ever&mdash;at what cost
to himself is happily not ours to fathom.</p>
<h4>III</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They sin who tell as love can
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Southey</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retrieved by Judy from a life of shame, her master had become
a respectable character, and the year afterwards found work as a
carpenter in an adjoining town, which compelled him to migrate
from our village.</p>
<p>How to dispose of his dog was the question.&nbsp; His lodgings
were situated in a crowded street, <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>through which a continuous stream of
the vehicles most dreaded by Judy, bicycles included, was passing
literally by night and day.&nbsp; Garden he had none&mdash;only a
small paved court-yard, tenanted in the main by children and
cats, Judy&rsquo;s natural enemies, while the nearest field was
two miles off.&nbsp; It was clearly impossible to transfer her to
such surroundings.&nbsp; Her future was settled thus.&nbsp; She
was left in his old rooms under special charge of the landlady,
and every evening when his day&rsquo;s work was done, wet or
fine, winter or summer, her master walked out to console her for
the long hours of his absence.</p>
<p>Such affection might have satisfied a reasonable dog.&nbsp;
But Judy was distinctly unreasonable.&nbsp; She
remembered&mdash;none better&mdash;how in former times she was
with him all the day, and sometimes, when she willed to have it
so, all the night as well.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> she was left to her
own devices, and only caught a hurried glimpse of him in the
evening when she was too sleepy to enjoy it.&nbsp; Besides, when
he left her at the garden gate, she was strictly enjoined not to
follow him&mdash;a prohibition which, while it whetted her
curiosity, was also regarded as a direct insult, viewed in the <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>light of
former days, and the unrestricted licence that had been accorded
to her then.</p>
<p>So Judy put on her considering cap.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
can&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;else he could never
leave me so late and get home in time for bed.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;m sure he doesn&rsquo;t drive or travel by train, else
his boots would never be so muddy when he comes here at
seven.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s clear that he walks.&nbsp; And, in
that case, a dog of the feeblest intelligence can follow in his
track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, on a wet and windy evening, when bicyclists were
not likely to be abroad, a little wistful-eyed face peered out
into the road, growing bolder and bolder as her master receded
from view, but ever and again hurriedly withdrawn whenever he
turned upon her with a threatening hand.&nbsp; Then he vanished
behind a hill, and Judy felt that her opportunity was come.&nbsp;
But a mob of children ran by with sticks in their hands, and Judy
slunk back in alarm.&nbsp; As soon as these had passed, she made
another attempt.&nbsp; But horror of horrors! a bicyclist
scorched by, and back she shrank again into the friendly
shade.&nbsp; At last the road was empty and silent.&nbsp; The
most careful inspection to the <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>right hand and to the left could
find no sign of life, and the keenest ears with which ever dog
was gifted failed to detect a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now or never,&rdquo; said Judy, and with tail erect,
and her tiny snub nose well to ground on the scent, she rushed
out into the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>An hour later a man was sitting down to his supper in the
adjoining town, cursing the noise of the street in which he
lived, with its wrangling women and screaming children, and cabs
and drays coming home for the night, when a little dog whined and
scraped at his door, and Judy rushed in, mud-stained and panting
and panic-stricken with fear.</p>
<p>It was probably the fright that killed her; it may have been
some injury.&nbsp; Her master never knew.</p>
<p>Only a brief friendship, measured by the standard of
time.&nbsp; But perhaps what Southey says is true, and
&ldquo;love is indestructible&rdquo;&mdash;even the love that
bound these two.</p>
<h3><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Our
Professor</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">No</span>: he was no Professor in the
recognised sense of the term; not a bit of it.&nbsp; Neither can
I tell you how he acquired the title, unless it were in
recognition of his original wit.&nbsp; He was simply my factotum
or Man Friday, ready for shooting, fishing, game-keeping, or
gardening, as the emergency of the moment required.&nbsp; He
could neither read nor write.&nbsp; But what are trifling details
like these in comparison with &rsquo;cuteness.&nbsp; Institute a
Tripos for originality and native wit, and Matthew would even
now, at the age of seventy, pass with high honours.&nbsp; But the
examination must be strictly <i>viva voce</i>, and not allowed to
wander into the region of conventional knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matthew,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t
work,&rdquo; as I bestowed a kick upon an object that lay prone
upon the lawn, when it ought to have been digging at our garden
border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but it&rsquo;s <i>preparin</i>&rsquo; for
it,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.&nbsp; For myself, I was knocked
<a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>out of
time, though I felt I was clearly within my rights.&nbsp; Fancy a
man, roused from a peaceful siesta, being ready with a retort of
such preternatural smartness!</p>
<p>Unhappily Matthew had two failings, by which his career was
handicapped.&nbsp; He was always lazy, and sometimes
inebriate.&nbsp; Of the former he never repented so long as I
knew him; the latter he was always repenting of and always
repeating.&nbsp; And the stage of repentance was the more acute
and the more grievous, at any rate to his neighbours.&nbsp; After
a bout of drinking he would wander through the house with his
hands on the pit of his stomach&mdash;as if the seat of his
iniquity lay there&mdash;moaning in a dreary, exasperating way,
&ldquo;The Lord forgie I; I&rsquo;ll never be drunk
agin.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you <i>expect</i> him
to?&rdquo; said his wife, in a tone of the bitterest sarcasm.</p>
<p>Every time he repented he took the pledge anew.&nbsp; The
consequence was, his bosom was garnished with blue
ribbons&mdash;his &ldquo;decorations&rdquo; he called
them&mdash;for he never cast off one when he assumed another, but
regarded them as an old soldier does his medals, traces of many a
scar and many a conflict, in which, unhappily, he always
fell.</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;Decorations!&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;fine
decorations!&nbsp; Call &rsquo;em rather sign-posts along the
road to perdition.&nbsp; If you stick to &rsquo;em all when
you&rsquo;re buried, they&rsquo;ll have no trouble in fixing
<i>your</i> whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he was particularly exasperating, she would
take the law in her own hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;My head&rsquo;s
swimmin&rsquo; like a tee-total,&rdquo; Matthew would say
pathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very last thing it ought to swim
like,&rdquo; retorted his wife, a woman with a ready wit,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll soon make it do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with
that she would take him in her strong arms and give him a twist,
as boys do when they give its first impetus to a top, after which
she would wait patiently for the result.&nbsp; The result was, of
course, collapse as soon as the primary impulse had run down;
whereupon she would catch him up when he was on the point of
falling, and bear him off to repentance and bed.</p>
<p>Matthew&rsquo;s dialect was unique.&nbsp; I question whether a
specialist could have reproduced it in its integrity, if only
because it never reached finality, but was always in process of
development.&nbsp; For myself, I had studied it for years, and
could never get any nearer towards the discovery of its
principles.&nbsp; Every day he was <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>startling you with some new
combination, as a rule strictly ungrammatical, but often a
reversion to some lost or more accurate phraseology.&nbsp; For
example: &ldquo;Let I go,&rdquo; &ldquo;Would you like I to do
it&rdquo;?&mdash;the latter a reproduction, as near as may be, of
the Latin formula <i>visne ego faciam</i>?&nbsp; A still more
perplexing characteristic in his speech was that he used many of
his words in a variety of senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cuss they nigglin&rsquo; weeds,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say,
and &ldquo;Cuss my nigglin&rsquo; toothache&rdquo;&mdash;phrases
in which the adjective (or participle) carried an appreciable
meaning, even when he didn&rsquo;t add the word
&ldquo;darn&rsquo;d&rdquo; as an explanatory gloss.&nbsp; But
when he transferred the phrase a minute afterwards to a splendid
crop of potatoes, in which my inexperienced eye could detect no
possible fault, I was all at sea again, and had to ask him to
explain himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I means they&rsquo;m small,&rdquo; he answered, with a
contemptuous sniff at my ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Matthew, you told me just now that
&lsquo;nigglin&rsquo;&rsquo; meant
&lsquo;darn&rsquo;d.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it do&mdash;darn&rsquo;d small;&rdquo; looking
at me as if he thought the epithet suited me as much as the
potatoes.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>When
Matthew had pneumonia and lay <i>in extremis</i>, his friends
came round to console him with the assurance that he would die at
the turn of the tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time, Matthew, do &rsquo;en begin to turn?&rdquo;
they said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At seven o&rsquo;clock, ezzactly,&rdquo; whispered the
inveterate old humorist.&nbsp; And it was not till the next
morning they discovered that he had defrauded them of one whole
hour of pleasant anticipation.</p>
<p>In his sober moments Matthew was a brilliant story-teller (in
both senses, I fear); though his brilliancy now is limited to
occasional flashes of wit.&nbsp; The following is one of his best
reminiscences.&nbsp; I have selected it out of many because I
have since discovered that it was founded on fact.&nbsp; Not only
was it authenticated by a clergyman in whose neighbourhood it was
enacted, but it was told and re-told by one of the actors in the
tragedy, though he had passed to a land from which no testimony
is available long before I heard the story at second-hand from
Matthew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in December, 1824, that it happened.&nbsp;
So Joseph told I.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This, at any rate, was
Matthew&rsquo;s recognised formula.)&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>he were
a great liar, and I didn&rsquo;t take no count o&rsquo; the main
o&rsquo; his tales; for he&rsquo;d tell you most anything, he
would; &rsquo;specially if he see&rsquo;d the price of a glass of
fourpenny for tellin&rsquo; it.&nbsp; But, in proof &rsquo;tis
true, they&rsquo;d tell it to the childer at night time, when
they was obstrepulous and wouldn&rsquo;t go to bed&mdash;just for
a joke like, to fright &rsquo;em to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in December, 1824; and not likely he were
to forget it.&nbsp; For &rsquo;twas the year of the great gale
(the &lsquo;Outrage&rsquo; they calls it hereabouts), when the
sea broke clean over Rudge and washed away th&rsquo; old church,
all but the chancel.&nbsp; Joseph never took kindly-like to the
new church they built for &rsquo;en higher up i&rsquo; the
valley, out o&rsquo; reach o&rsquo; the sea.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
too spick and span, he said, to suit he&mdash;all white and
glitterin&rsquo; like chalk&mdash;though &rsquo;twere built of
the best Portland stone, and a sight prettier to my
thinkin&rsquo; than the tumble down old barn that&rsquo;s all
that&rsquo;s left o&rsquo; th&rsquo; old un.&nbsp; But the
visitors and gentry, they takes after Joseph, and for one what
goes to see the new church there&rsquo;s hundreds &rsquo;ll bring
their vittles and sit and peant th&rsquo; old
&rsquo;un&mdash;studyin&rsquo; all the tombstones, and
what&rsquo;s writ on &rsquo;em&mdash;mostly shipwrecks it be, for
I doubt if there&rsquo;s half-a-dozen <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>stones in th&rsquo; old grave-yard
but what tells of someone or t&rsquo;other who was drownded at
sea.&nbsp; In that one gale of &rsquo;24 &rsquo;twas thousands
that perished, and all that was found on &rsquo;em Joseph buried
there, when the sea gived back her dead, and he could get at his
grave-yard.&nbsp; Though, to be sure, nought was left but the
chancel, so you could scarce say as how, poor souls, they got a
decent buryin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow &rsquo;twas in that very month, just arter the
&lsquo;Outrage,&rsquo; that one Price&mdash;a farmer he called
hisself&mdash;was livin&rsquo; high up yonder among they hills
that you can see faint-like in the distance, nigh agin they
ricks.&nbsp; A bleak and dreary place it were at the best
o&rsquo; times, and a job to get at it at all when a strong
so&rsquo;wester were blowin&rsquo;.&nbsp; And most every November
it <i>do</i> blow cruel strong along they high downs, wi&rsquo;
no cover to speak on&rsquo;t &rsquo;cept scraps of fuz and
heather, and a small thorn tree, may be, now and agin, wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;is branches all leanin&rsquo; to the nor&rsquo;-east, as
though &rsquo;twas an old man a holdin&rsquo; out his arms for
shelter.&nbsp; And the road to Price&rsquo;s farm were no better
nor a sheep run.&nbsp; A godless man Price were, as you&rsquo;d
expect wi&rsquo; a man who lived so far from all we decent
folks.&nbsp; And he never com&rsquo;d <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>nigh no church.&nbsp; Passon, he
said, didn&rsquo;t suit he, and he weren&rsquo;t a goin&rsquo; to
trapeze over hill and dale&mdash;not he&mdash;when chance
&rsquo;twas he&rsquo;d find no passon and no service at
t&rsquo;other end.&nbsp; And if passon went to he&mdash;as he did
now and agin&mdash;he&rsquo;d find the door shut in his
face.&nbsp; And for vittles&mdash;not a bite nor a sup of
anything did he offer &rsquo;en, though passon was a rare
&rsquo;un at that kind of work.&nbsp; Sunday after Sunday
he&rsquo;d look in reg&rsquo;lar nigh about dinner time, and
savour by his nose, he would, where there was a chance for
&rsquo;en of summat enticin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Not but what
&rsquo;twere bad for the childer where he <i>did</i> settle
hisself, for &rsquo;twas little of the pudden was left for they
when he&rsquo;d a&rsquo; had his turn on&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howsomever, &rsquo;twas there Price lived, wi&rsquo;
hisself for his company.&nbsp; So no wonder strange tales got
abroad about &rsquo;m.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas said, though Joseph
never gived no heed to &rsquo;t, that three wives had entered his
doors, and never one of &rsquo;em had come out agin&mdash;no, not
for buryin&rsquo;.&nbsp; And Joseph must have known on&rsquo;t if
so be they had, seein&rsquo; he were clerk and sexton and
grave-digger, let alone the head o&rsquo; the choir.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas thought that he&rsquo;d buried &rsquo;em in another
parish, more nigher to the house <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>he lived in, and wi&rsquo; a better
road &rsquo;long which to carry &rsquo;em.&nbsp; But, Lord save
us! tweren&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One morning, early in December, &rsquo;twas nine
o&rsquo; the clock, may be, or thereabouts&mdash;for Joseph had
just been out to pen the sheep in the church-yard&mdash;a tall
fine old genelman called at the door, and he knowed by his dress
&rsquo;twere the Bishop.&nbsp; Not that he&rsquo;d cast eyes on
&rsquo;en before, for our youngsters are confirmed a way off;
there baint enough of them to claim a Bishop for
theirselves.&nbsp; But he knowed &rsquo;twere the Bishop, what
wi&rsquo; his gaiters, fittin&rsquo; as though they&rsquo;d
grow&rsquo;d to his legs, and his broad hat as shiny as if
you&rsquo;d smoothed it wi&rsquo; a flat iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good morning to you,&rsquo; says he, as pleasant
as anyone could say it.&nbsp; &lsquo;You be clerk of the parish,
baint you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;True, your wusshup,&rsquo; he
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;And sexton too&rsquo; says he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Right you be; and grave-digger and choir leader as
well,&rsquo; for he thought it no sin to make the most to
&rsquo;m of his preferments.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;I want you for a buryin&rsquo;&mdash;this night at eight
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A buryin&rsquo;, your
wusshup,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and at night?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, and three on &rsquo;em,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;all in
one grave.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, it <i>do</i> sound <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>mortial
strange, your wusshup, but &rsquo;tis you that says it, and not
I.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better go at once,&rsquo; he
says, &lsquo;and begin the grave, for you won&rsquo;t have none
too much time to spare on&rsquo;t, &rsquo;specially as I want it
done on the quiet, so to speak, and you mustn&rsquo;t take no
hand to help you, and meet me punctually as ever is at eight
o&rsquo;clock at Farmer Price&rsquo;s, up along the hill, and
bring a lantern and the parish hand-bier &rsquo;long wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;e.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hadn&rsquo;t much time to ponder on it, as you may
suppose, with that grave to dig, and no one to gi&rsquo; &rsquo;m
a helpin&rsquo; hand.&nbsp; And mortial hard work he found it,
too, for the frost set in early that year, and the ground that
hard that, young and lusty as he were, he found it a job to get
the pick-axe into &rsquo;en.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howsomever he did get &rsquo;en done, and at eight
o&rsquo;clock he was at Farmer Price&rsquo;s door, and
&rsquo;twas opened to &rsquo;en by the Bishop hisself.&nbsp; And
so, hand in hand as you may say, he and the Bishop, they went
into the kitchen.&nbsp; And there right facin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em&mdash;packed up agin the wall like so many old
grandfeyther clocks&mdash;stood three coffins, with a piece of
glass let in &rsquo;em to show the face, and a dead woman in
each!</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;Close handy they were to &rsquo;m when he took
his meals, or smoked his pipe; and when he felt a bit lonesome
(so he told Joseph) he&rsquo;d go up to &rsquo;em and ask
&rsquo;em how they did, and if they felt comferable.&nbsp; And
fresh as peant they were, too: only a bit shrivelled, like as
&rsquo;twere an apple in April.&nbsp; Perhaps &rsquo;twas the
heat of the kitchen, or may be some stuff he&rsquo;d put in along
wi&rsquo; &rsquo;em; anyhow you could see their faces right
enough and tell they was women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Take &rsquo;em down,&rsquo; says the Bishop;
&lsquo;Farmer Price&rsquo;ll lend &rsquo;e a helpin&rsquo; hand:
and we&rsquo;ve none too much time to get &rsquo;em back to the
churchyard and bury &rsquo;em.&rsquo;&nbsp; Joseph hisself could
scarce do nought but stare at &rsquo;em.&nbsp; To think that that
godless man had kep&rsquo; &rsquo;em there&mdash;one on &rsquo;em
for nigh on ten years&mdash;never thinkin&rsquo;, not he, that he
was keepin&rsquo; &rsquo;em tied hand and foot to this world,
with never no chance of a resurrection till he took it into his
wicked head to let &rsquo;em go.&nbsp; And there they&rsquo;d
a&rsquo; been for ten years longer&mdash;for just so long he
lived&mdash;if Bishop hisself hadn&rsquo;t got wind on&rsquo;t
and come down right away to bury &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow they <i>did</i> get decent burial&mdash;the <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>three on
&rsquo;em&mdash;at last.&nbsp; For they had Bishop, and Joseph
and Farmer Price; though I don&rsquo;t take no count o&rsquo; he,
&rsquo;cept that he helped to lower &rsquo;em and fill in the
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Joseph were right glad, he were&mdash;and so he
told I&mdash;to see the rare tug he had in draggin&rsquo; they
three dead women up hill and down hill &rsquo;cross to the
church-yard.&nbsp; For Joseph never gived &rsquo;en no
helpin&rsquo; hand&mdash;you may take your oath
on&rsquo;t&mdash;though he did make a show of pushin&rsquo; at
the bier whensomever the Bishop looked his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t no one never hear on&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Yes,
they did.&nbsp; But they didn&rsquo;t take no count
on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Our people baint over wise about religion, and
things were done in those days that&rsquo;d make a rare
potheration now.&nbsp; Besides, you see, Bishop were there, and
he made a sight o&rsquo; difference.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a rare
fine buryin&rsquo;, people thought, wi&rsquo; a Bishop to put you
unnerground; though &rsquo;tis true he hadn&rsquo;t his fine
gran&rsquo; toggery on, and his girt white sleeves.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The actors in our humble drama are dead and gone.&nbsp; The
Bishop and Price and Joseph have, each in his turn, been followed
to the grave, only with less eccentric rites.&nbsp; But the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>story of
the farmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Happy Family&rdquo; still lingers in
the village, and is told and re-told round many a cottage hearth
under the quaint but significant title of &ldquo;Price&rsquo;s
Menagerie.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; himself came round
to-day&mdash;&ldquo;for a pipe of baccy, Sir, if you have such a
thing about you&rdquo;&mdash;so I have utilised him to correct
his own proof sheets.&nbsp; &ldquo;There baint nothin&rsquo;
wrong in &rsquo;em, <i>Master</i> Fred (this to a man of sixty!),
so fur as I sees.&nbsp; Only you says &lsquo;gived&rsquo; where I
says &lsquo;gi&rsquo;ed.&rsquo;&nbsp; But taint no odds.&nbsp;
Like enough they&rsquo;ll guess what you means whatsomever you

clearness of expression.</p>
<h3><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>The
Cruel Crawling Foam</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a touch of the old
wilfulness in Ronald, which cost him dear, and saddened all his
future life.</p>
<p>A windy storm-swept sky, though the wind was only playing with
the sea as yet.&nbsp; Still, it met us, as we went down to the
shore, with a drift of sand that stung the face like
pin-pricks&mdash;trying, one might easily fancy, to warn us back
from our foolhardy enterprise.</p>
<p>A painter would have needed only his blends of grey to paint
the scene, till we came upon it, and added, I suppose, a patch of
colour.&nbsp; Wiser people than ourselves kept quietly indoors;
and the sand, the sea, the gulls, and the hurrying scud could all
have been rendered in varying shades of grey.&nbsp; It is, to me,
the most fascinating hue that the changeful sea can wear.&nbsp;
One great artist, whose sketches are the glory of Girton College,
knew it well.&nbsp; <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>With an unerring eye for this sad
unity of tone, she admits no faintest touch of colour into her
cold grey wastes of sea and sky.</p>
<p>It was a risky and foolhardy attempt on the part of Ronald,
and one that he has bitterly repented of, to launch a boat that
afternoon.&nbsp; I can never quite forgive him for the sorrow it
was to bring on us.&nbsp; But his wife would have it so.&nbsp; It
was her greatest enjoyment to put out to sea on such a day.&nbsp;
A calm aimless drift, in life or on the sea, was out of harmony
with her bright and nerve-wrought soul.</p>
<p>Where Ronald was still more at fault was in the choice of our
third hand.&nbsp; True, we had a fair amount of experience
between us.&nbsp; But, with a strong south-wester to fight
against, weight and strength are the two things needed, and will
often win through a gale when experience is powerless.&nbsp;
Ronald, however, was in one of his obstinate moods.&nbsp; He
would take Oswald or no one, and his wife said ditto.&nbsp; Now
Oswald was a lad of eighteen: a good seaman, I grant, but quite
unequal to the work we had in view.&nbsp; However, he was the son
of Ronald&rsquo;s favourite gardener, and had been his
wife&rsquo;s pet scholar at her Sunday school, since which time
he had been her <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>devoted slave, making himself useful about the house,
and looking after her specialities in the garden and
conservatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that boat too big for us, Oswald?&nbsp;
Remember, there are only two of us to handle it, for
Ronald&rsquo;s ill, and can&rsquo;t be reckoned on for
much.&nbsp; Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, it intends to blow harder
than this before it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re right in a way.&nbsp; But
we&rsquo;ve got the winch to lower and haul her up with.&nbsp;
And once at sea she&rsquo;ll be a deal safer and stauncher than
that one,&rdquo; pointing to a lean, wall-sided thing that was
our only alternative.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides, we&rsquo;ll set very
little canvas; indeed, to all appearance we shan&rsquo;t want
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a sail we had that afternoon!&nbsp; I think that I, who
had countenanced it least, enjoyed it most.&nbsp; For Ronald was
only just recovering from influenza, and certainly not up to a
rough and tumble experience of this sort.&nbsp; And Oswald, too,
for a lad of his spirits, was strangely depressed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never felt like it before,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I
shall be thankful when we&rsquo;re safe on shore again.&nbsp; Our
old people at home would say that I was walking over my grave, or
some folly of the kind.&nbsp; <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>But that can&rsquo;t be out
here,&rdquo; he added, with a poor attempt to laugh it off.</p>
<p>First of all we took her along under the lee of the shore,
where we were able to carry a fair amount of sail, and when we
had worked her well round the bay we put her head straight for
the south-east, and, with the wind on our beam, raced out into
the open sea.</p>
<p>It was a longer and heavier business to work her back again,
with the wind right in our teeth, and freshening steadily as the
evening wore on.&nbsp; Fortunately for us it had only blown
fitfully, and without much weight in it till now.&nbsp; It was
still &ldquo;making up its mind,&rdquo; as sailors say, whether
it would blow or not.&nbsp; But as we were beaching her in a deep
sandy cove it had finished apparently with indecision, and began
to blow in earnest.</p>
<p>Just as we had landed, and Oswald was preparing to follow us,
a terrific squall burst full upon the boat, which lay beam on to
it.&nbsp; Relieved of her last weight, as Oswald stepped on
shore, she yielded to the pressure, and, heeling over on her
side, pinned him to the ground.&nbsp; In a moment the horror of
it broke upon us.&nbsp; What could we do, the two of us, even if
Ronald hadn&rsquo;t been shorn of half his <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>strength?&nbsp; It would have taken ten men to pull her
over in the face of the gale that was blowing.&nbsp; And the tide
was rising rapidly.&nbsp; It was idle to look for help.&nbsp; We
had beached her in a quiet sequestered cove, used only by
ourselves.&nbsp; But it was closer to Thorpe Hill than the
regular landing stage, and, after a hard day&rsquo;s work, saved
us a tedious beat along the coast when the wind was blowing from
its present quarter.&nbsp; The high land above us was private
property, with no right of way, and on a day like this, for it
was beginning to rain, would be lonely as a desert.</p>
<p>Our first thought was of the winch.&nbsp; We had had one
fitted up under the cliff in order to save labour in launching
and beaching the boat.&nbsp; But, even if it were possible, we
had no time nor knowledge how to alter the gear so as to utilise
the leverage for righting her.&nbsp; No doubt the incoming tide
would help us later on, but its help, when it did come, would
come too late.&nbsp; Yet to do anything was better than to do
nothing.&nbsp; So we took the balers out of the boat, and,
kneeling down beside Oswald, attempted the hopeless task of
freeing him by scooping out the sand on <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>either
side, till he begged us to desist, as the boat only fell over
more heavily, and imprisoned him still deeper in the yielding
sand.</p>
<p>And all the time that we were working, Kingsley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;cruel, crawling foam&rdquo; beat persistently upon my
brain, maddening me with its ghastly congruity.&nbsp; And yet
&ldquo;cruel and crawling&rdquo; it was not.&nbsp; Quicker it
could scarcely have been, and its quickest was (I saw) its
kindliest.&nbsp; Already it was playing with the lad&rsquo;s
hair, though his mistress, careless of the risk she ran, knelt
down beside him and supported his head in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray for me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She whispered the words in his ear, though if she had shouted
them with all her strength they would not have reached us on the
other side of the boat, where, with a hope that was hopeless now,
we were straining ourselves to no purpose in the attempt to right
her.</p>
<p>But Oswald was satisfied.&nbsp; A look of repose and even
comfort settled upon his face before the last words came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have made death
easy for me.&nbsp; And you have done so <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>at the risk
of your own life.&nbsp; Tell them at home I was not
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent down and kissed his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;cover my face.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Our
Queen</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the stars&mdash;they shall fall, and
the Angels go weeping,<br />
Ere I cease to love her, my Queen, my Queen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Our</span> Queen&rdquo; she was to
me and Ronald, ever since we first met her at Broadwater, and
Ronald had dared to love her.&nbsp; And now that she is gone from
us there is little fear that her title will ever be
questioned.&nbsp; Neither he nor I need any coarser picture of
her than that engraved by memory.&nbsp; But for others&mdash;for
those who knew her little, or less well&mdash;let me try to call
her back in clearer and less shadowy outline.</p>
<p>A woman this, to whom you gave your confidence with your first
greeting, and never afterwards withdrew it.</p>
<p>Not the face to tempt an artist by its regularity of feature
or beauty of colouring.&nbsp; Madonna-like some would call it,
and so it was in sweet and loving trustfulness, but far too
mobile and human, too full of interest <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>and human
sympathy to suggest the reposeful placidity of conventional
art.&nbsp; Instinct, rather, with the life and animation that
inspires the best work of Gainsborough and Reynolds, and frank
with a simplicity that is careless of its surroundings, and
therefore conquers them.&nbsp; The centre of her interest was
home; thence it radiated outwards.&nbsp; From her family to her
friends, from friends to neighbours, her influence passed in ever
widening circles like a ripple that, stirred in the centre of
some pool, travels to the extremest edge.</p>
<p>Nature creates not many such.&nbsp; Happy the man who has
known and honoured one.</p>
<p>Over and over again I have tried to unravel the secret of her
inexplicable charm.&nbsp; Seating myself in some sequestered
nook, where Ronald himself would find it hard to discover me, it
has been my pleasure, through a long evening&rsquo;s
entertainment, to watch her in every graceful word and greeting
that she exchanged with her friends.&nbsp; It was a satisfaction
even to see her walk across the room&mdash;a lost art (they tell
us) in these hurried and inartistic days.&nbsp; I tried to learn
the mystery from her conversation.&nbsp; The words told nothing,
but the tone was less secretive; and, after all, how much more
the <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>tone
always does tell of the spirit of the speaker than the
conventional coinage we have devised in words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s that sweet little bairn of yours, Mrs.
Macpherson?&rdquo;&nbsp; (She was half Scotch by birth, and now
and again her descent betrayed itself in a pretty mannerism of
word and accent.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I lost my heart to her, I did,
when I met her yesterday on the Parade with her
nurse.&rdquo;&nbsp; A greeting old as time can make it, but new,
entirely new, in the sympathy she threw into it right from the
depths of her heart.&nbsp; No one could hear her and not believe;
and Mrs. Macpherson was won.&nbsp; Sometimes, almost awestruck, I
asked myself, Is there, <i>can</i> there be a human nature so
nearly approximating to the divine as to possess the verity of
universal sympathy?&nbsp; And, knowing this woman so nearly and
so closely as I knew her, it was impossible, I found, to answer
the question with a negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are in doubt, play trumps&rdquo; used to be the
rule in whist, and &ldquo;If you are in doubt, wear black&rdquo;
would be my advice to a lady in difficulty about her dress.&nbsp;
And Ronald&rsquo;s wife suggested it.</p>
<p>To-night she was looking her best&mdash;in <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>black, and
silver and diamonds.&nbsp; She and Ronald were giving their
largest ball of the season, due regularly at this period of the
year, and every family of standing for miles round had sent its
representative.&nbsp; For a wonder I hadn&rsquo;t been watching
her that evening, and was surprised to feel her gentle touch on
my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me, Fred,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I want you
for a few minutes upstairs.&nbsp; Poor old nurse is dying.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been expecting it, you know, at any moment for some
weeks past.&nbsp; But I wish it hadn&rsquo;t come to-night.&nbsp;
It looks so heartless to have all these people about us; and yet
I know she wouldn&rsquo;t have had the ball put off.&nbsp; She
was the last person ever to think of self.&nbsp; Still it
<i>does</i> look unfeeling to go to her straight from all this
light and merriment.&nbsp; Yet I feel it less than most
would.&nbsp; Life and death seem to me so closely mixed, that
wherever one is there you may expect the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; But oughtn&rsquo;t
Ronald to be there too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but, you see, we cannot both be spared.&nbsp; He
must be here to make excuses for me if I am missed.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to spoil <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the pleasure of all these young
things during their one great evening of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll change your dress?&rdquo; I said
aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not.&nbsp; If death is always so very near
to us, it hardly seems worth while to change one&rsquo;s dress to
meet him.&nbsp; Besides, I have a special reason in this
case.&nbsp; All her life long dear old nurse has liked to see me
in my ball-room dress, and I&rsquo;m sure she will
to-night.&nbsp; She said it gave her an idea of what the angels
were like better than did her Bible.&nbsp; And if it could give
her one comforting thought to help her, I&rsquo;d have dressed on
purpose as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little need for Ronald to make excuses for our
absence.&nbsp; The old woman was dying when they called us.&nbsp;
But her eyes opened and brightened as she saw her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! an angel?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, but
my own dear mistress, the best angel of them all, and dressed as
I would have her&mdash;not yet in her robe of white&mdash;not
yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, with her mistress&rsquo; face pressed
close to hers, and the diamonds and silver rippling and
shimmering about her pillow, our old nurse died as she would have
chosen.&nbsp; Half-an-hour later &ldquo;Our <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Queen&rdquo; was back in the ball-room: bright, and, to
all appearance, cheerful as the rest.&nbsp; None that saw her
would have guessed the scene from which she had come back to
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heartless&rdquo; they would have said, and
will say so still.&nbsp; But Ronald and I knew better.&nbsp; Her
heart was in the nursery up stairs.</p>
<p>She wears her white robe now.&nbsp; But, in reverence be it
written, I would fain see her come to welcome me, clothed, as she
was clothed that night, in black and silver and diamonds.</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>When her own time came, as it did soon after, she met death
with the same fearless, friendly courage.&nbsp; Her thoughts were
wholly for those who were to stay, and she was even playful in
urging upon me never to leave Ronald and the children, but learn
to &ldquo;take her place.&rdquo;&nbsp; I own I was troubled at
times by what seemed almost levity in the face of death, till I
began by degrees to realise her point of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will be a very short distance,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;perhaps into another room, perhaps not even so far
as that; and the time (to me, at any rate) will certainly seem
short&mdash;no <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>longer than the night of sleep which separates us from
our loved ones till the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp; And of the future
she had no fear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;could persuade me that the light which has been fanned and
quickened here will be extinguished for ever by the incident we
call death.&nbsp; The jest would be too horribly, inconceivably
malicious.&nbsp; Yet our choice lies between this and the
crowning impossibility of a self-created world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not thoughtlessly, but in the hope of finding a standing
ground for myself, I would ask her sometimes if she had no
misgivings regarding the re-existence of the body, and mutual
recognition, and the endless difficulties that centre round the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;none.&nbsp; Why
should I?&nbsp; Look at the natural world.&nbsp; I know that
space must be either limited or limitless; but can I form a
conception of either alternative?&nbsp; Yet the problem may be
simplicity itself to some larger mind than ours.&nbsp; So why
trouble myself about difficulties which may be easier of solution
still to those who hold the key?&nbsp; And you think it hard, I
know&mdash;you have often said so&mdash;that many should die, as
we know they must, without a friend on earth to <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>whom they
can look forward for a welcome when they reach the further
shore.&nbsp; To me, I confess, it seems quite the contrary.&nbsp;
Surely the burst of welcome will be greater in their ears than in
ours, who have lived surrounded by friends, and never known the
dearth of sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And every difficulty, as I raised it, she met with the same
calm, unquestioning certainty.</p>
<p>She died, as she had lived, in ministering to others.&nbsp;
Oswald&rsquo;s death was the first blow.&nbsp; From the exposure
and the physical effects she soon recovered&mdash;sooner than we
expected, considering her frail and uncertain hold on life.&nbsp;
But the horror of it was always with her, especially the feeling
that it was she who had suggested the fatal experiment.&nbsp;
Ever and again, as the subject was referred to, I could see her
shuddering at the reminiscence, blaming herself with what was
surely the only reproach that can have harassed her bright and
blameless conscience.&nbsp; And the remembrance was still upon
her when her two children sickened with the scarlet fever.&nbsp;
Considering her weak state, and consequent liability to
infection, the doctor had strictly forbidden her to enter their
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can make no <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>promises,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if
they want me I must go.&nbsp; Till then I will obey your
orders.&nbsp; We are told to give up father and mother, and
perhaps oneself for one&rsquo;s husband, but our children, I
think, have a prior claim to all.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so she watched
and waited at their door, stealing along the corridor in her robe
of white at all hours of the night, listening and listening to
hear if a summons came.</p>
<p>One night, unhappily, it came&mdash;a summons she was
powerless to resist.&nbsp; The elder child was delirious, and she
heard it moaning piteously, &ldquo;Mother, mother, why
don&rsquo;t you come to me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation she had entered the room, signing her own
death-warrant in the act.</p>
<p>She did not linger long in dying; lingering was little in her
way.&nbsp; On a grey morning in October, just ten days after she
was taken ill, the gun which welcomes sunrise from the
signal-station on the pier echoed like a call.&nbsp; She opened
her eyes to greet us, and with the diamonds flickering again
about her head&mdash;only they were sunbeams now&mdash;she passed
to that &ldquo;larger life&rdquo; of which she, if anyone, held
the key.</p>

155</span>Bindo A Sketch</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> last notes of &ldquo;Jerusalem,
Jerusalem!&rdquo;&mdash;sung as no other boy on earth could sing
it&mdash;had just died away in a storm of applause.&nbsp; Now and
again the surge of voices reached the green-room in a muffled
roar, where Eric was protesting to the Manager that nothing would
induce him to sing another note that night.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had four songs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
on earth do they want more?&nbsp; As it is, I shall break my
voice some day in that confounded hall.&nbsp; It was never meant
for a boy to sing in&mdash;all wood and iron and glass&mdash;with
nothing to help you or carry the voice.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> sing, that&rsquo;s flat; tell them I&rsquo;m
ill, or my mother&rsquo;s come for me, or anything you
like.&nbsp; Sing again, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell them your mother&rsquo;s come for
you,&rdquo; said the Manager with a laugh, &ldquo;but, remember,
they&rsquo;ll be clamouring for &lsquo;A boy&rsquo;s best friend
is his mother&rsquo; if I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>As if
to confirm Eric in his determination there came a knock at the
door, and a boyish face peeped <i>in</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry,
Hudson, if I&rsquo;ve interrupted business, but they told me the
show was over, and I want Eric for supper.&nbsp; By the way, you
can come too, if you like.&nbsp; Andrews and Thorne are there
already, and have finished supper by this time, I expect.&nbsp;
But there&rsquo;ll be some champagne and lobster-salad left for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Lord Eastonville, I&rsquo;ll come with
pleasure, but I must first go and quiet these lunatics.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re roaring for Eric like a lioness robbed of her
cub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the three were entering a room in Hope
Square, so rich in its decorations of china, tapestries, and
antique bronzes that it might have been transported by a slave of
the lamp direct from Aladdin&rsquo;s palace, or have done duty
for a catalogue of Roman luxury: &ldquo;The merchandise of gold
and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and
silk and scarlet and all manner of vessels of most precious wood
and of brass and iron and marble and frankincense, and souls of
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the fire (for it was early in May) stood an oval table,
covered with old glass and silver <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>in pleasant confusion.&nbsp; The
fruit&mdash;a distinctive feature&mdash;piled artistically in a
ribbed basket of the Queen Anne period, not disposed at the rate
of four apples here, flanked by four oranges there, after the
fashion dear to the soul of the British householder when he calls
his neighbours to a feast.</p>
<p>The three new comers were greeted with a round of applause as
hearty in spirit as the cheer which had followed them from the
hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bindo, you&rsquo;ve the very boy we&rsquo;ve been
longing for.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve finished supper and used up our
talk, and it&rsquo;s too late for a theatre and too early for
bed.&nbsp; Singing will just fill the interval before
cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a note from me, Thorne, till I&rsquo;ve had some
supper.&nbsp; I must clear my throat from the dust of the hall
with champagne first.&nbsp; Why you&rsquo;re as bad as the
audience, who think that songs can be pumped out of one as easily
as you can get squeaks out of a gutta-percha doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Eric is better employed we can introduce the party.</p>
<p>Lord Eastonville, who owns the rooms, is a thorough gentleman
of the well-bred English <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>type, with brains enough to carry
him safely through life&mdash;good-looking, generous, easy-going
to a fault, and twenty-five.&nbsp; Too fond, it may be, of taking
his ease, as all well-to-do Englishmen are now-a-days, but a man
who could fight for his country, as in the old Crimean times,
when war galvanised our lethargy into life.&nbsp; War is no
unmixed evil; it carries with it a blessing in disguise.&nbsp; It
is the scare and shadow of war that is the curse without the
blessing.</p>
<p>Thorne, as a minute in his company would prove to you, is a
hard-headed journalist; witty, and an excellent talker; facile,
of course, with his pen, and ready to turn out a new theology as
easily as he could write an article on the last discovered
butterfly or grub.</p>
<p>Andrews is a graduate of London University, spending with
Eastonville the remnant of a holiday.&nbsp; Fairly humorous and
incorrigibly deaf&mdash;never more so (his friends say) than when
a subject bores him&mdash;he is himself a trifle of a bore
to-night.&nbsp; In his latest translation of Vergil
&ldquo;ploughed with a team&rdquo; has become in the hands of the
printers &ldquo;ploughed with steam,&rdquo; an anachronism that
pleases him mightily.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>He is
also sorely exercised over the term &ldquo;Prolegomena,&rdquo;
used in connexion with our classical editions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Either the word&rsquo;s bad Greek,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;or else it&rsquo;s rank nonsense.&nbsp; &lsquo;Things that
are being said before&rsquo; means just nothing at all.&nbsp;
What they want is a Perfect, &lsquo;things that have been said
beforehand,&rsquo; which is not only more grammatical, but also
(he adds with a chuckle) much more descriptive of prefaces in
general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t understand Greek and Latin,&rdquo;
said Thorne, &ldquo;so suppose we talk English.&nbsp; I have been
studying you carefully, Bindo, and have come to the conclusion
that you look highly picturesque among all that fruit and
flowers.&nbsp; I wonder what made you so good looking; was your
father particularly lovely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither my father nor my mother, Thorne, though she
<i>has</i> contrived to marry again; and the consequence is
I&rsquo;m not so well looked after as I ought to have been, else
I shouldn&rsquo;t be here to-night.&nbsp; Fate, I think, must
have made a judicious blend of the best points in his face with
the best features of hers.&nbsp; And the result is me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First class grammar, Bindo.&nbsp; She must <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>have sent
you to a good school at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else to ask, old man?&nbsp; You seem to be in
an inquisitive mood to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; who taught you to sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le bon Dieu, I suppose, as Patti said.&nbsp; I had only
the training of a country choir boy.&nbsp; By the by, my
master&rsquo;s name was Thorne, a matter full of interest to
you.&nbsp; I believe I sang by intuition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Hamiltonian philosopher,&rdquo; muttered Andrews,
&ldquo;only he has developed theory into practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, when your voice goes I shall put on
mourning,&rdquo; said Eastonville, &ldquo;not black, for I
don&rsquo;t believe in it.&nbsp; Purple&rsquo;s the farthest I
can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may put on white or canary yellow, like a heathen
Chinee, for all I care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your temper, Bindo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Eric, <i>alias</i> Bindo, how shall I describe him?&nbsp;
A fair boy, delicate looking, but with lungs that can fill the
biggest concert room in London, with wavy golden hair flung back
on his forehead, and the long dreamy eyes so dear to the soul of
Raphael.&nbsp; In fact, it was Raphael&rsquo;s picture of Bindo
Altoviti (long <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>supposed to be a portrait of the painter) that had won
him his name.&nbsp; Framed in the cabin window of a Bournemouth
steamer (excursion boats in these days do not condescend to port
holes), his arms resting on the sill, the resemblance had struck
me irresistibly.&nbsp; From that day he became
&ldquo;Bindo&rdquo; to all of us, and would scarcely have
recognised an appeal to him as &ldquo;Eric,&rdquo; if we had
lighted on the name by accident.&nbsp; His hair perhaps was one
of his most telling points.&nbsp; It reflected under strong
lights brilliant flakes of gold, isolated like the motes that are
suspended in certain liqueurs.</p>
<p>But after all it was his manner that took so much with all his
friends.&nbsp; He had the timid deprecating caress of a
half-tamed animal, like Hawthorne&rsquo;s Donatello before he had
won himself a soul.&nbsp; Alas! poor Bindo was hardly allowed
time to win it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the show like to-night, Bindo?&rdquo;
asked Eastonville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the same old game.&nbsp; Nothing would suit them
out of sixty songs but &lsquo;Jerusalem,&rsquo; &lsquo;Rags and
Tatters,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Home, sweet Home.&rsquo;&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t mind &lsquo;A boy&rsquo;s best friend&rsquo; for an
encore when they are in a strictly domestic <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>mood.&nbsp;
But anything really worth singing they won&rsquo;t look
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll follow their better mood and have
&lsquo;Jerusalem.&rsquo;&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got back your voice
by now, old chap, and we&rsquo;ve been waiting for you patiently
this last half-hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again that night the glorious voice rang out into the
thin air, startling the silent square.&nbsp; Windows were hastily
flung up, and the word &ldquo;Bindo&rdquo; was passed from sill
to sill.&nbsp; Even a drowsy canary was stimulated to try a note
or two in emulation of a method more attractive than its
own.&nbsp; And through the open window came, for an
accompaniment, the voice of London, soft as the murmur of a
far-off sea.</p>
<p>With the end of the song a sharp rattle of applause ran round
the square, marked by distinctive intervals, like the volley at a
soldier&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Bindo,&rdquo; said Eastonville, &ldquo;it would
pay you to send the hat round to-night.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a
fiver, young &rsquo;un, to open the bank with, though why I
should give it you passes my comprehension.&nbsp; A boy who can
earn ten pounds a night at sixteen is a sight better off <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>than I
am.&nbsp; If you lose it, you&rsquo;ll have to try the
others.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty well cleared out.&nbsp; After all
you&rsquo;re detestable, Bindo.&nbsp; Just when we want you most,
your voice will be gone, and you&rsquo;ll have spoiled us for all
other singing, precisely as the great Sarah has spoiled us for
any acting but her own.&nbsp; If we could only forget and start
fresh with each week, how nice and pleasant everything would
be.&nbsp; I believe Nelly is right in &lsquo;Cometh up,&rsquo;
when she says that memory is often a cruel gift.&nbsp; No one
would choose to remember a feeble show, or to spoil his enjoyment
of average singing by a recollection of the best.&nbsp; Why are
&lsquo;Jack Sheppard&rsquo; and &lsquo;Genevi&egrave;ve de
Brabant&rsquo; practically withdrawn from the London stage?&nbsp;
Because elderly playgoers cannot forget the days when Mrs. Keeley
played &lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; or when Emily Soldene and the Dolaro
drew all Mayfair to Islington by the witchery of a
serenade.&nbsp; But now for &lsquo;A boy&rsquo;s best
friend&rsquo;&mdash;we&rsquo;re all in a domestic mood
to-night&mdash;and then cards.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Bindo was very docile as a rule, especially in the hands of
those who loved and cared for him.&nbsp; But on some points he
was obdurate as <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>steel.&nbsp; For instance, I could never persuade him,
try what I would, to invest his salary, nor could anything induce
him to learn a profession against the day when his voice should
fail him.&nbsp; Singing, he said, had come naturally to him; a
good voice, a good ear, and a little training had done the trick;
and he thought, or pretended to think, that the evil day, when it
did come, would bring with it its own resource.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sufficient unto the day is the <i>good</i> thereof&rdquo;
was Bindo&rsquo;s motto throughout.</p>
<p>And it was impossible to teach him the value of money.&nbsp;
He spent it royally on others, lavishly on himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where have you been, Bindo?&rdquo; I said to him one
Monday, when he hadn&rsquo;t turned up as usual on the previous
afternoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I took Harry out of town.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s been seedy, you know, and wanted change.&nbsp; So we
went to Brighton.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you travelled
first-class, and put up at the Bedford, and lost money to him at
cards in the evening?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have hit it
<i>exactly</i>, old man,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>I believe that most of his money went on Quixotic kindnesses
of this sort.&nbsp; One night when I was with him at the
Queen&rsquo;s Hall (he <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>liked to run round to me between his
&ldquo;turns&rdquo; and criticise the show from the front) his
salary for two nights went before it was earned to the first
violin, a blind little snuff-powdered man, but Bindo&rsquo;s very
particular friend, because he had stumbled in getting down from
the stage and damaged his instrument.</p>
<p>When the end did come, it came suddenly.&nbsp; His voice
cracked on an upper G&mdash;sudden and short like the string of a
violin&mdash;in the very hall he had so emphatically abused for
its acoustic deficiencies.&nbsp; Of course he came to me, if it
can be said that he came to me, when he had always been with me
for most of his time.&nbsp; But the life bored him.&nbsp; I had
my own work to do in the evenings, and couldn&rsquo;t go with him
to restaurants, theatres, and concerts, the excitement of which
had become a second nature to Bindo.&nbsp; And so we drifted,
little by little, but still very surely, farther and farther
apart.</p>
<p>It was about this time that his friend Harry, the same whom he
had entertained so royally at Brighton, fell ill.&nbsp; Bindo had
been anxious about him for a long while, and never passed a day
without seeing him.&nbsp; But it was only quite lately that the
doctors had begun to <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>suspect a rapid form of
consumption.&nbsp; Bindo was full of trouble.&nbsp; I think he
liked Harry best of all his friends, perhaps excepting me.</p>
<p>One day he burst into my room, with something more akin to
tears in his eyes than I had ever seen in them before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What <i>is</i> to be done, Charlie?&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
given Harry the sack at his office because he&rsquo;s too ill to
do his work properly.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t even keep it open
for him for a week or two on the chance.&nbsp; What brutes they
are!&nbsp; And, poor old chap, he&rsquo;s got nothing.&nbsp; If
it were only this time last year, and I had my voice again, we
could do famously.&nbsp; I wish I&rsquo;d taken your advice, old
man, and saved my pile while I had the chance.&nbsp; By the way:
happy thought!&nbsp; I have a heap of rings and pins and watches
at home that the swells gave me last year for singing at their
matinees and concerts&mdash;enough of them to stock a
pawnshop.&nbsp; By Jove! they <i>shall</i> help to stock
Attenborough&rsquo;s; and we&rsquo;ll live on the proceeds, at
any rate till things look more rosy.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was off then
and there, and for the next six months, till Harry died, I
scarcely saw him.&nbsp; One excitement in his case had cast out
the others, and while Harry lived he hardly cared to be outside
his room.&nbsp; <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Brother and nurse in one he was to him&mdash;with him
night and day&mdash;and, whatever money or love could do, Bindo
did for him.</p>
<p>Afterwards he came back to me, looking a trifle older, a
trifle more depressed; but improved, or so it seemed to me, by
the experience he had undergone.&nbsp; I forgot that there are
natures receptive of vigorous and even intense impressions, but
absolutely incapable of retaining them.&nbsp; So soon as one
predominant idea has passed from the brain, its place must be
occupied by another, for good or else for evil.&nbsp; Which of
the two it may be, seems almost a matter of indifference; it is
the law, so to speak, of their being that it <i>should</i> be
indifferent.</p>
<p>I almost wished in those days that I could fall ill
myself.&nbsp; Five or six months of nursing under Bindo&rsquo;s
hand would have been a lazy delight to me, and (selfish as it may
seem) better far for him than the life he was leading.&nbsp;
Unhappily I never felt fitter, much too fit and too self-occupied
to be interesting to Bindo, and so he left me for others, more at
liberty and likely to be more amusing.</p>
<p>All this time he was (to quote his own words) &ldquo;looking
about for something&rdquo;&mdash;the <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Micawber-like expression that does
duty for an idle life.&nbsp; Whatever Bindo&rsquo;s
interpretation may have been, I know it made him very late in
coming home of an evening.&nbsp; Yet he never asked me for
money.&nbsp; His resources seemed boundless, and the stock of
rings and watches inexhaustible.&nbsp; But, portable and useful
property as they are, you must have a good supply of them in hand
to live upon it for a year in the style Bindo was doing.&nbsp;
Besides, it occurred to me as strange that I had never had a
sight of them; in old days I had always had the first view of any
present that was made him.&nbsp; On another point, too, he was
inflexible as ever.&nbsp; Advice and help towards securing
permanent employment he absolutely and positively refused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Better that, old boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than do what
most people do&mdash;bother their friends all round for an
opinion when they&rsquo;ve decided all along to follow their
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your practical and steady-going individual&mdash;the one, for
example, who can &ldquo;see nothing&rdquo; in <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i>&mdash;never admits into his reckoning the
influence of excitement.&nbsp; It disturbs and disarranges his
equilibrium of life.&nbsp; Yet, disparage it as you may, it is
one <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>of
the most important factors in shaping life and character, and
perhaps the very strongest lever that operates for the
development of vice.&nbsp; Fortunately, a fair number of mankind
can do with a small and weak modicum of this dangerous
stimulant.&nbsp; Individuals like Bindo, who ask for more, are
classed among the eccentricities of nature, for whom it is
impossible to prescribe.&nbsp; Yet, think what it means for a boy
of sixteen, without discipline or experience to steady him, to
drop, literally in a moment, from notoriety to neglect, activity
to stagnation; almost from life to death.</p>
<p>No wonder Bindo pined and drooped.&nbsp; I knew the
alternative that lay before him: life and death&mdash;not in
metaphor this time, but in sober earnest.&nbsp; Yet I let him go,
for he had taught me himself, if I had wanted the knowledge, that
no man can cage a human will.&nbsp; So from the very moment I had
become more hopeful about him, the gulf widened between us.&nbsp;
But only in companionship; never in spirit&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For, till the thunder in the trumpet be,<br
/>
Soul may divide from body, but not we,<br />
One from the other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile he had retained all his old friends&mdash;no one who
had known Bindo was <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>in a hurry to part company with
him&mdash;but he had made other and less reputable ones.&nbsp;
The strange and (to me) disquieting element in the situation was
that he never, even now, seemed to be in want of money.&nbsp; Yet
Harry&rsquo;s illness alone must have cost him a fortune.&nbsp;
All his old luxuries were resumed.&nbsp; Dinners to his friends,
at which Bindo was always paymaster, with periodical trips to
Brighton and Bournemouth for change, succeeded one another with
the same regularity as when the boy was earning &pound;10 a
night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where <i>does</i> the money come from?&rdquo;
I asked myself again and again.&nbsp; Alas! the knowledge was to
come soon.</p>
<p>Late one evening, as I was finishing an article for the editor
who employed me, Thorne and Eastonville called at my rooms.&nbsp;
That they had come on no pleasant errand was written on their
faces.&nbsp; &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; said Thorne, &ldquo;we are
here on a disagreeable business.&nbsp; I hope it may prove less
disagreeable than it looks.&nbsp; The fact is we&rsquo;ve been
losing a lot of things for some time past; at least we&rsquo;ve
tried our level best to <i>think</i> we&rsquo;ve lost them.&nbsp;
But it won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; The thing is far too systematic to
be accidental.&nbsp; Sometimes it has <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>been money&mdash;a sovereign or two
at a time; then it was a diamond ring of Eastonville&rsquo;s that
went, and then some valuable scarf-pins of mine.&nbsp; So the
thing must be stopped.&nbsp; But who has done it?&nbsp; I may as
well out with it at once, though it burns my throat to tell
it.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t help fancying it&rsquo;s Bindo.&nbsp; No
one but he has had access to our rooms at all hours, and you know
how suspicious he has made us all by the pile of money he&rsquo;s
been spending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: it <i>is</i> Bindo, Thorne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was the good of attempting to deny it, when it flashed
across me in a moment where all his jewellery had come
from?&nbsp; No, not all perhaps.&nbsp; Probably&mdash;for I never
asked him&mdash;he had started with articles that were
legitimately his own, and then, when these had failed him, had
been tempted to supplement them less creditably in the time of
Harry&rsquo;s need.</p>
<p>Of course we found the things, as I anticipated, at
Attenborough&rsquo;s; all of them, that is, but one.&nbsp; Bindo
was not the boy to try and hide his work, as an expert would have
done, by distributing the articles at different shops, or even by
signing under an assumed <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>name.&nbsp; On the contrary, there
was a contemptuous candour in his method of dealing that actually
surprised and puzzled us for a moment at starting.</p>
<p>I would allow no one but myself to liquidate on behalf of
Bindo.&nbsp; But I as steadily refused to be the bearer to him of
the discovery we had made.&nbsp; None of the others volunteered
for the office, or showed the faintest ambition to be the one
selected for the murder of a friendship.&nbsp; So we cast lots
for the office, whose it should be, in true melodramatic style,
and the lot fell upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old fellow,&rdquo; said Eastonville.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bindo&rsquo;s a deal fonder of you than he is of the rest
of us, and won&rsquo;t take it so hardly if it comes through
you.&nbsp; The fact is we&rsquo;ve spoiled him; all of us, that
is, but you.&nbsp; And he knew it too, and I believe he liked the
preaching you gave him better than all my five-pound notes; not
that he showed any objection to the notes, I&rsquo;m bound to
say.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t look so savage, old man.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m bound to try and laugh over it, because, if I
didn&rsquo;t, I feel sure I should do the other thing.&nbsp; And
after all this business may be the making of Bindo.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>But
he didn&rsquo;t know Bindo as I did.&nbsp; The boy came to me
with outstretched hand, and with the old frank look in his
eyes.&nbsp; But I could not trust myself to return it.&nbsp; What
I did, must, I felt, be done quickly.&nbsp; If I waited for words
in which to break the news to him; above all, if I gave him the
chance of speaking first, I knew it was all up with me.&nbsp; So
I just put the things on the table in front of him&mdash;how I
hated the sight of them!&mdash;and said, &ldquo;These things have
come into my hands, no matter by what means.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
looked at them, and the faintest flush imaginable crept over his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before you leave me to-night we will do them
up for the post, and you will address them to the respective
owners and leave them in my hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not dare to
look at him, but turned away to another table, making up the
parcels one by one and handing them to him where he stood behind
my back.&nbsp; He addressed each parcel as he received it, never
betraying by a word or sign what I knew the effort must have cost
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Eric, you and I part company.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
saw him wince at the name; almost as if he had received a
blow.&nbsp; No doubt it implied to him, far more plainly than I
had intended, <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>that the Bindo of the past was lost beyond
recall.&nbsp; It was not said in heedlessness, still less in
heartlessness; it was simply loss of self-control.&nbsp; The old
familiar name <i>could</i> not be forced past my lips.&nbsp; In a
moment I saw what I had done, and would have given worlds to
repair it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bindo,&rdquo; I cried impulsively,
&ldquo;come back.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it was too late; the mischief
was done.&nbsp; I had lost my last chance by that one word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he answered, and was gone.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The characters we meet with in this world are composite, all
of them&mdash;not saint or sinner; not this or else that, but
something betwixt and between; the good in them not permanent,
the bad in them not hopeless; and Bindo&rsquo;s short life had
exemplified the fact with startling clearness.</p>
<p>From that day forward my influence over him was gone.&nbsp; He
must have kept studiously out of my path&mdash;an easy thing for
him to do, as he knew all my habits and places of resort.&nbsp; I
used to try and persuade myself that I was guiltless of the
result, whatever it might be; <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>that &ldquo;unstable as water&rdquo;
his character was past all guidance, and would in any case have
drifted to the end that seemed to be in view.&nbsp; Yet it was
hard to feel all the while that a strong, kind word from me that
night might have nerved him to fresh energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Bindo?&rdquo; I asked of Eastonville one
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to the dogs, and pretty rapidly, too, I&rsquo;m
afraid.&nbsp; The last time I saw him, he was with Hutchinson and
all that crew.&nbsp; You know what comes of mixing with loafers
like that.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t look at me, though I tried
hard to get a talk with him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d had more to drink,
too, than a boy of seventeen can carry.&nbsp; The pity of it
all.&nbsp; What a voice he had, and what a good fellow, too, at
heart!&nbsp; How he nursed poor Harry!&nbsp; Few Samaritans of
the present day would have given up six months of their time to
spend them in a sick room.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s
all up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Thorne do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Bindo fights shy of us all, and no wonder
either.&nbsp; I am sure I should do the same in his place.&nbsp;
If <i>you</i> could only have got hold of him, and made him feel
that we were rather glad than otherwise that our useless <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>belongings
had gone towards nursing Harry, he&rsquo;d have got back his
self-respect and been less shy of us.&nbsp; But our last hope
went when <i>you</i> failed.&nbsp; What the plague made you call
him Eric instead of Bindo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven only knows,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;or its
Antipodes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told Thorne one day of Eastonville&rsquo;s report, and asked
him what he thought of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just nothing at all,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
knows no more of what Bindo&rsquo;s doing than all the rest of
us.&nbsp; For myself, I believe he&rsquo;s got work of some
kind.&nbsp; I grant he&rsquo;s seen sometimes at shady music
halls with shady companions; and that&rsquo;s what Eastonville
means.&nbsp; But, after all, a fellow must have some one to speak
to in the evening, especially if he&rsquo;s at work all day; and
if he&rsquo;s lost his old friends he must fill up their places
with the best he can.&nbsp; Besides, it&rsquo;s quite possible
that Bindo has grown wise enough by this time to make sure they
do him no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few months later Thorne dropped in again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
you&rsquo;ll be happy, I suppose; at least I am.&nbsp; Bindo
starts to-morrow for Brazil in the <i>Magdalena</i>.&nbsp; We
came across him to-day.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s had work on hand all the
year, <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>though he kept it quietly to himself; and now
he&rsquo;ll be quit of all his old associations and be able to
make another, and, I hope, a better start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made up my mind, of course, that I must see him before he
sailed.&nbsp; But how to do it?&nbsp; Fortunately I knew the name
of the boat he was to travel by, unless he had wilfully put
Thorne off the scent.&nbsp; But it was too late to get a train
that night, and, as the boat I knew sailed at two o&rsquo;clock,
it gave me none too much time to hunt him up at Southampton.</p>
<p>When a letter came to me next morning by the early post,
requiring an article at once for the afternoon papers, it was
only what I expected.&nbsp; Fate had come between me and Bindo
every time I had wished to help him, and she was at her old games
again.&nbsp; So I sat down and wrote off my
article&mdash;doggedly rather than savagely&mdash;in the spirit
of one who gives up the game against chance, yet knowing, all the
time I was writing, that I was losing my train, and that it was
doubtful whether the next one would catch the <i>Magdalena</i> at
all.&nbsp; The official at the Dock entrance told me that she was
already throwing off from the quay wall, and it would be quite <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>impossible
to get on board.&nbsp; &ldquo;Far and away your best
chance,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;is to run round this way to the
Dock gates.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be there before she is, for it
takes a lot of time to back and turn her.&nbsp; Then if you want
to say good-bye to anyone <i>very</i> particularly (and he
smiled), you&rsquo;ll get a word with her perhaps.&nbsp; For the
vessel&rsquo;s loaded deep, and her portholes won&rsquo;t stand
very high above the quay wall.&nbsp; Besides, she&rsquo;ll only
creep through the gates, but you&rsquo;ve no time to
lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hardly stopped to thank him <i>then</i>.&nbsp; On my way
back he got, not only thanks, but, to his great astonishment, a
five-shilling piece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well; he must have wanted to
see her badly,&rdquo; I heard him whisper to his mate.</p>
<p>The preliminaries of throwing off, backing, warping, were all
over by the time I reached the gates, and the big vessel was
beginning to make a move under her own steam.&nbsp; I looked
eagerly for Bindo among the passengers.&nbsp; Fate had been kind
to me, and given me yet another chance.&nbsp; What if I missed it
like the last?&nbsp; But she favoured me this time.&nbsp; He was
leaning over the deck-rail, watching the leave-takings as the
great vessel swept slowly past the wall.&nbsp; His cap was thrown
back and <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>his hair blown off his forehead.&nbsp; What a boy he
looked to be starting a new life in a new world, without a friend
and with worse than failure for the past!</p>
<p>Just then he caught sight of me.&nbsp; For a moment he
hesitated&mdash;I could <i>see</i> him hesitate; then he left the
deck and re-appeared at a port-hole in the aft part of the ship,
framed once more (and it was my last picture of him) as the very
Bindo of old.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;old
man; it was good of you to come, after the way I&rsquo;ve treated
you.&nbsp; Thanks again, most faithful of friends, and
good-bye.&nbsp; Forgive and forget.&nbsp; This time, believe me,
I&rsquo;ll go straight.&nbsp; By the way,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;just give this parcel for me to Fred&mdash;naming one of
his chums&mdash;I had intended it for the pilot, but it will be
safer in your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wave of the hand, as the ship headed for the open water, was
the last I saw of Bindo.&nbsp; But a load was off my mind as I
walked back to the station.&nbsp; I could look forward hopefully
now and patiently to our next meeting.</p>
<p>Glancing at the parcel he had given me, I found it was
addressed to myself.&nbsp; It contained a small diamond ring
without word or <a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>comment.&nbsp; At the time when we found the jewellery
at Attenborough&rsquo;s, this ring had been missing, and, as it
belonged to me, I had said nothing to the others about it.&nbsp;
I might easily have lost it, and at any rate I gladly gave Bindo
the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; He had pledged it apparently at a
different shop; perhaps because it was mine, and he did not wish
it to be discovered with the rest; perhaps to remind him more
vividly of the task he had set himself during the year to
come.&nbsp; Till this ring could be redeemed, he must wait and
work in London, and though all his hopes were centred in life
abroad, it must not be thought of till this one act of reparation
had been done.&nbsp; I never saw or heard from him directly
again.</p>
<p>Two years later he died of yellow fever in hospital at Rio;
and his last act, while he still had strength to hold a pen, was
to write me a loving letter of farewell, enclosing a cheque that
covered the sums I had expended on his account.&nbsp; The letter
was forwarded to me by the nurse who attended him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<b>Is it well with the
lad</b>?&nbsp; <b>It is well</b>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>&lsquo;Declined with Thanks&rsquo;<br />
A Postscript</h2>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Read</span> and
rejected&rdquo; would be a more satisfying formula.&nbsp; But the
Oracle is discreetly vague, and condescends not to
particulars.&nbsp; Editorial reticence is surely a queer anomaly
in these days when a reason is required for everything.&nbsp;
When my own effusions have come back to me with the trite
ascription, I could have welcomed enthusiastically the scantiest
information, the liveliest abuse, in exchange for that
exasperating commonplace.</p>
<p>Sometimes even this amount of formal recognition was
deferred.&nbsp; At first I augured hopefully from the delay, till
experience taught me otherwise.&nbsp; Once, when an editor had
kept my MS kicking about in this way, I actually wrote him my
mind in free and unorthodox language.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unwise, most
unwise,&rdquo; you will say.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but oh! <i>so</i>
satisfactory.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>Add to which, my letter effected its
purpose.&nbsp; He made up his mind then and there on the merits
of my article and &ldquo;declined it <i>with
thanks</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The italics are his own.)</p>
<p>But the mystery remains a mystery.&nbsp; He did not reveal it
to me, in spite of his gratitude for my contribution, and I still
hold to my opinion that such delay is discourteous to a male
contributor, and ungallant to a lady.&nbsp; Besides, what is the
reason?&nbsp; Is it that the editor waits to see what space he
has got left at the finish, and then accepts an article, not for
its merits, but for its length, on much the same principle as a
lady will ask you at breakfast for <i>just</i> the amount of
bread that will suit a remnant of butter, or <i>vice
versa</i>?&nbsp; If so, Aristophanes had anticipated the process,
or one very nearly resembling it&mdash;&ldquo;Man, man,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;they are weighing my tragedy as if it were a pound
of beef!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the way, why shouldn&rsquo;t the editorial chair be thrown
open to competition?&nbsp; It is thus we elect our Professors, or
some of them, at Cambridge.&nbsp; Let a candidate for the office
be required to compose an &ldquo;Exercise&rdquo;&mdash;say a
complete story for the magazine he aspires to conduct.&nbsp; So
should we respect an editor <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>more, or (possibly) fear him
less.&nbsp; At any rate, no order of men, least of all one which
examines others, should be debarred now-a-days from the privilege
of being examined in its turn.</p>
<p>The fear is that, if my suggestion were acted upon, it would
empty the Universities of their Professors.&nbsp; Who could
resist the attraction of a post which limits the bulk of its
correspondence to one conventional formula?&nbsp; Besides, to a
tired Tripos examiner, the duty of looking over a few hundred
magazine articles per month would be a frolic&mdash;a light and
airy holiday task.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;d think the rules of the
competition a trifle rough on the candidates, and might be
tempted to violate decorum by an occasional word of encouragement
and help.</p>
<p>Apart from the suspense they inflicted upon me, due no doubt
to the care they bestowed on the investigation, I think the
editors were not far out in their judgment of my work.&nbsp; It
always looked so heavy, even to a partial critic like myself, on
the morning after I had written it.&nbsp; Once, in despair, I
showed an article to a great novelist, who is happily also a
great friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;What <i>is</i> the <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>reason,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;that it always looks
so lumpy and devoid of wit and smartness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder he had patience to read it through.&nbsp; Perhaps it
was my presence that inspired him.&nbsp; Then he said, &ldquo;Not
so bad in sense, but, as you say, terribly cumbrous in
form.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s the matter with
it.&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s description, description, description,
instead of action, action, action, as Demosthenes recommended in
a kindred art.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an essay&mdash;good enough so far
as the matter goes&mdash;but wearisome and heavy almost beyond
<i>my</i> endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to be done with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it up,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and make them
talk.&nbsp; See, here&rsquo;s a man called Fred.&nbsp; Make him
talk to the first woman he meets&mdash;Susan, I see, you&rsquo;ve
called her&mdash;let him ask her how she is, and where
she&rsquo;s going, and whether it&rsquo;s a fine day.&nbsp; Do
this with every proper name you can find, and you&rsquo;ll soon
see the mass disintegrate and look promising for the
printer&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed his advice, and (triumph of triumphs) the article
was accepted.&nbsp; But I felt unhappy and disquieted even in my
hour of success.&nbsp; The fact is, the plot of my story <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>was a
dream.&nbsp; Yes; it came straight to me at midnight from the god
Oneiros himself, complete to the very smallest detail, and where
was I to look for another?&nbsp; I very seldom dream at all, and
never, before or afterwards, a complete story; and, as I can
never originate a plot, my chances for the future are the reverse
of promising.&nbsp; Yet I labour on with a persistency beyond all
praise, and always during the night&mdash;a detrimental practice,
involving great expenditure of candles and tissue.&nbsp; By
daylight my ideas entirely evaporate, and I have abandoned the
attempt as hopeless.&nbsp; The sight, too, of a fair blank sheet
of paper makes my thoughts take wing on the instant.&nbsp; They
can only be arrested on scraps of waste paper or (best of all) on
the pages of a novel.</p>
<p>It is said that the criticisms on Corelli are literally
&ldquo;given to the dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my revenge upon a dull
novel is, I flatter myself, more recondite still.&nbsp; I punish
a poor story by using it as the palimpsest for a poorer
one.&nbsp; Hence the highest tribute I can pay to my heroes in
literature is an unspoken (I mean an unwritten) one.&nbsp; I
leave their pages immaculate.&nbsp; My mind might be teeming at
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>midnight
with the noblest of thoughts, yet I could not bring myself to
record them, even in thought, upon the pages of &ldquo;Quentin
Durward,&rdquo; &ldquo;Esmond,&rdquo; &ldquo;Silas Marner,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Return of the Native,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wuthering
Heights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judging it for power alone&mdash;power that never flags from
the first page to the last&mdash;I know of nothing that
approaches &ldquo;Wuthering Heights,&rdquo; except the preface
Charlotte Bronte wrote for it.&nbsp; Yet I never read the book
without compassionating the authoress.&nbsp; The creation of a
character like Heathcliff must have been one long struggle
against herself, to be faced without flinching, as one of the
penalties of genius.&nbsp; What her own choice would have been is
shown by the relief with which she flings behind her the
nightmare of the past to picture the hope and happiness of
Earnshaw&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Her second book, if she had lived to
write it, would certainly have been more genial; it could
scarcely have been so great.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
